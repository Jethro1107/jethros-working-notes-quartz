		- [[Classical 'Sanger' dideoxy sequencing]]
				- Sangar sequencing is used for sequencing of DNA sequences of 500-800bp
				- It is invented by [[Frederick Sangar]] in 1977
				- [[Principles of Sangar sequencing]]
					- Sangar sequencing is based on the principle that 3'OH is required for DNA elongation
					- It involves amplification of DNA, where dNTP (deoxynucleotides) is mixed with ddNTP (dideoxynucleotides)
					- When ddNTP is incorporated into the growing nucleotide chain, it results in chain termination due to the lack of 3'OH
					- This results in formation sequences of different sizes, which can be separated by gel electrophoresis to work out the sequence
