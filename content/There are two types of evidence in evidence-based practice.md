# There are two types of evidence in evidence-based practice
| Disease-oriented practice                      | Patient-oriented practice                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Focuses on pathophysiology, markers of disease | Helps patient live longer and better, associated with mortality, morbidity and quality of life |
| Patients do not care about such information    | Involves mortality, morbidity and quality of life of patients                                  |
