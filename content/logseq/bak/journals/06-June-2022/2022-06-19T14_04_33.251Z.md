- CPRS Embryology (Key terms)
	- Development of the heart
		- Partitioning of heart fields
			- The heart originates from the splanchnic meosoderm
			- The primary heart feild is a cluster of progenitor heart cells arranged in a horseshoe arrangement, craniolaterally
			- The primary heart feild gives rise to parts of the atrium and the entire left ventricle
			- The secondary heart field is derived from some cells of the primary heart field and ventral to the pharynx
			- The secondary heart field gives rise to portions of the atrium, the right ventricle and parts of the outflow tract (condus cordis and truncus arteriosus)
		- Formation and positioning of heart tubes
			- Formation of heart tube
				- 2 Endocardial tubes formed lateral to the notochord
				- During lateral body folding, endocardial tubes fuse to give heart tube
				- ![[Pasted image 20220606144522.png]]
			- Positioning of heart tube
				- Cranial caudal folding pushes the primitive heart tube and the pericardial cavity towards the cervical region and then the thorax
				- ![[Pasted image 20220606144710.png]]
				- ![[Pasted image 20220606144717.png]]
			- Components of primitive heart tube
				- Truncus arteriosus - outflow tract
				- Bulbus cordis - right ventricle and outflow
				- Primitive ventricle - left ventricle
				- Primitive atrium - left and right atrium
				- ![[Pasted image 20220606145001.png|375]]
		- Cardiac looping
			- Cranial portion of heart tube (ventricles and outflow tract) bend ventrocaudally and to the right
			- Caudal portion of heart tube (atria) bend dorsocranially and to the left
			- ![[Pasted image 20220606145201.png]]
			- Abnormality in cardiac looping can result in dextrocardia
- [[Public health]]
	- Health promotion as an extension health education
		- Aims to tackle determinants of health at all levels, aimed at the whole population (not just high risk groups)
		- ![[Pasted image 20220606175357.png]]
		- Health promotion - A process that enables indiviudals to gain control over their lives and to improve their health
		- 3 aims of health promotion:
			- 1. Informed choice - increase knowledge and awareness
			- 2. Empowerment - encourage individuals to take actions to improve their health
			- 3. Creating opportunities - ensure the circumstances for individuals to make health choices is always an easy choice
		- Approaches to health promotion:
			- Medical approach - identify high risk individuals
			- Behavorial change approach - aims to encourage individuals to make behavoriar changes and take action to improve their health (Behavorial change may be guided by state of change model or health belief model (illness cognition and behavior))
			- Education approach (informed choice)
			- Empowerment approach
			- Social change approach
	- Health behavior and behavorial change
		- [[Factors affecting health behavior]]
			- ![[Factors affecting health behavior]]
		- Transtheorectical model of behavorial change
			- Changes does not occur in an instant, rather it involves many steps
			- There are 5 states of change as described by the TTM of behavorial change
				- Pre-contemplation - not intending to make changes
					- Aim:
						- Increase awareness for the need of change (any concerns of current behavior)
						- Envision possibility of change
				- Contemplation - considering a change
					- Aim:
						- Analyze the pros and cons of the current behavorial patterns (hopefully they see that the cons outweigh the pros)
				- Preperation - preparation of changes, or making small changes
					- Aim:
						- Increase commitment
						- Create an actionable plan
				- Action - actively engaging in a new behavior
					- Aim:
						- Implementing strategies for change
						- Sustain commitment to change in face of difficulty
				- Maintainence - sustaining the change over time
					- Aims
						- Sustaining change over time and in different situations
						- Avoid relapse to old behavior
	- Illness cognition and behavior
		- May concern the difference between [[IAS66 Health, Illness and Disease#^4da560|Disease and illness]]
		- ![[IAS66 Health, Illness and Disease#^eb2a2b]]
		- Illness cognition ^b0c784
			- Illness cognition is the common sense belief of their own illness
			- There are 5 components of illness cognition
				- Identity of disease (name, and associated symptoms)
				- Perceived cause of disease (may draw on multiple causal models)
				- Timeline of disease (acute vs chronic) ([[The general public has a poor concept of chronic diseases]])
				- Consequences of disease on their life
				- Curability or controllability (curable? controlled by who? Internal or external locus of control)
		- Illness behavior
			- What is illness behavior?
				- Illness behavior is the action taken in response to signs and symptoms of an illness. 
				- Health seeking behavior is a form of illness behavior
			- Leventhal's self-regulatory model of illness behavior illustrates the relationship in which illness cognition may affect illness behavior
				- In the self-regulatory model of illness behavior, an assumption is made: When facing a problem, an individual will be motivate to solve the problem and re-establish a sense of normalcy
				- There are three steps to the self-regulatory model of illness behavior, triggered by a situation stimuli (e.g symptoms of illness)
					- 1. Interpretation (making sense of a problem, or establishing [[#^b0c784|illness cognition]], or an emotional response to the illness)
					- 2. Coping (Approach coping or avoidance coping)
					- 3. Appraisal of the coping strategy
			- A type of illness behavior is help-seeking behavior
				- Whether an individual is going to engage in help-seeking behavior is largely dependent on two factors: Illness recognition (associated with the identity of disease) and illness danger.
