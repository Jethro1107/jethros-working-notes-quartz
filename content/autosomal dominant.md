# autosomal dominant
```ad-note
title: autosomal dominant disorders
- Autosomal dominant disorders only require 1 copy of the mutant allele
- Hence, all carriers (no matter carying one or two copies) are affected
- If one parent is heterozygous, and the other is homologous recessive, there is a 1 in 2 chance
- [[The onset of autosomal dominant disorders often occurs late in life after the individual has completed reproduction to pass on the mutated allele]]
