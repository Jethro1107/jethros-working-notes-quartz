# Dosage compensation by X inactivation
- Females have double the number of [[X chromosome]] genes than males, which may produce toxic double dose
- This is prevented by dosage compensation
- During embryonic phase, one of the X chromosome is silenced randomly and condensed to form Barr body
- Random X inactivation is the reason why females are considered to be genetically mosaic
