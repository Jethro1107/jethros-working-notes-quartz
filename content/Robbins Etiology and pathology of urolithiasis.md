# Robbins: Etiology and pathogenesis of urolithiasis
## Etiology and Pathogenesis

There are four main types of calculi ( [Table 20.13](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/t0070) ): (1) _calcium stones_ (about 70%), composed largely of calcium oxalate or calcium oxalate mixed with calcium phosphate; (2) another 15% are so-called _triple stones_ or _struvite stones,_ composed of magnesium ammonium phosphate; (3) 5% to 10% are _uric acid stones;_ and (4) 1% to 2% are made up of _cystine_ . An organic mucoprotein matrix, making up 1% to 5% of the stone by weight, is present in all calculi. **Although there are many causes for the initiation and propagation of stones, the most important determinant is an increased urinary concentration of the stones’ constituents, such that it exceeds their solubility (supersaturation).** A low urine volume in some metabolically normal patients may also favor supersaturation.

-  _Calcium oxalate stones_ are associated in about 5% of patients with hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria, such as occurs with hyperparathyroidism, diffuse bone disease, sarcoidosis, and other hypercalcemic states. About 55% have hypercalciuria without hypercalcemia, which is caused by several factors, including hyperabsorption of calcium from the intestine (absorptive hypercalciuria), an intrinsic impairment in renal tubular reabsorption of calcium (renal hypercalciuria), or idiopathic fasting hypercalciuria with normal parathyroid function _._ As many as 20% of calcium oxalate stones are associated with increased uric acid secretion _(hyperuricosuric calcium nephrolithiasis),_ with or without hypercalciuria. The mechanism of stone formation in this setting involves “nucleation” of calcium oxalate by uric acid crystals in the collecting ducts. Five percent are associated with _hyperoxaluria,_ either hereditary (primary oxaluria) or, more commonly, acquired by intestinal overabsorption in patients with enteric diseases. _Hypocitraturia,_ which can be idiopathic or associated with acidosis and chronic diarrhea of unknown cause, may produce calcium stones. In a variable proportion of individuals with calcium stones, no cause can be found (idiopathic calcium stone disease).
    
-   _Magnesium ammonium phosphate stones_ are formed largely after infections by urea-splitting bacteria (e.g., _Proteus_ and some staphylococci) that convert urea to ammonia. The resultant alkaline urine causes the precipitation of magnesium ammonium phosphate salts. These form some of the largest stones, as the amount of urea excreted normally is very large. Indeed, so-called _staghorn calculi_ occupying large portions of the renal pelvis are frequently a consequence of infection.
    
-    _Uric acid stones_ are common in individuals with hyperuricemia, such as patients with gout, and diseases involving rapid cell turnover, such as the leukemias. However, **more than half of all patients with uric acid calculi have neither hyperuricemia nor increased urinary excretion of uric acid.** In this group, it is thought that a tendency to excrete urine of pH below 5.5 may predispose to uric acid stones, because uric acid is insoluble in acidic urine. In contrast to the radiopaque calcium stones, uric acid stones are radiolucent.
    
-   _Cystine stones_ are caused by genetic defects in the renal reabsorption of amino acids, including cystine, leading to cystinuria. These stones also form at low urinary pH.

It can therefore be appreciated that **increased concentration of stone constituents, changes in urinary pH, decreased urine volume, and the presence of bacteria influence the formation of calculi.** However, many calculi occur in the absence of these factors; conversely, individuals with hypercalciuria, hyperoxaluria, and hyperuricosuria often do not form stones. It has been postulated that stone formation is enhanced by a deficiency in inhibitors of crystal formation in urine. The list of such inhibitors is long, including pyrophosphate, diphosphonate, citrate, glycosaminoglycans, osteopontin, and a glycoprotein called nephrocalcin _._
