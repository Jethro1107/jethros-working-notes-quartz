# CPR89: Drugs used in urinary tract infections
### Pharmacology of drugs used in urinary tract infections
#### Antibiotics
- Drugs against cell wall synthesis
	- [[CPR79 Drugs used in the treatment of pulmonary infections#Penicillin]]
	- Fosfomycin
		- **MOA of fosfomycin**
			- It acts as an phosphoenolpyruvate analogue, inhibiting enolpyruvate trasferase (MurA)
			- This inhibits the synthesis of N-acetylmuranic acid (NAM), thus inhibiting peptidoglycan synthesis

- Drugs against protein synthesis
	- [[CPR79 Drugs used in the treatment of pulmonary infections#Tetracycline]]
	- [[CPR79 Drugs used in the treatment of pulmonary infections#Macrolide antibiotics]]
- Antifolates
	- Cotrimoxazole
		- **Composition of cotrimoxazole**
			- Combination of trimethoprim and sulmethoxazole in a ratio of 1:5, an antifolate drug
		- **Antimicrobial activity of cotrimoxazole**
			- Bacteriostatic
		- **MOA of cotrimoxazole**
			- Trimethoprim and sulmethoxazole are structually similar to intermediates of folate cycle, thus sequentially inhibiting the folate cycle
			- Inhibition of folate cycle inhibits DNA synthesis

		- **Adverse effect of cotrimoxazole**
			- Skin rash
			- Megaloblastic anemia
			- Haemolytic anemia in G6PD deficiency
- Drugs against DNA synthesis
	- [[CPR79 Drugs used in the treatment of pulmonary infections#Quinolones and fluoroquinolones]]
	- Metronidazole
		- **MOA of metronidazole**
			- Metronidazole is metabolised into metabolites that form unstable molecules with DNA, thus causing DNA break
			- This inhibits DNA synthesis
- Nitrofurantoin
	- **Pharmacokinetics of nitrofurantoin**
		- Low tissue penetration (not used for pyelonephritis, only for uncomplicated cystitis and prophylaxis of recurrent infections)
		- Low drug plasma level, but concentrated in urine (advantageous for treating cystitis)
		- Results in harmless brown urine
	- **MOA of nitrofurantoin**
		- Nitrofurantoin exerts a greater effect on bacterial cells than human cells as it is actively metabolised and activated by nitrofuran reductase
		- This generates electrophilic intermediates that damage DNA, respiration, ribosome proteins and macromolecules in bacteria
		- Due to its many MOA, resistance is less likely to develop
#### Antifungals
- Action on cell membrane
	- Fluconazole
		- **MOA of fluconazole**
			- Inhibits ergosterol synthesis
			- This increases susceptibility of fungal cell membrane to osmotic pressure, resulting in cell lysis
	- Amphotericin B
		- **MOA of amphotericin B**
			- Binds to ergosterol, forming pores on cell membrane
			- This increases susceptibility of fungal cell membrane to osmotic pressure, resulting in cell lysis
- Action on DNA synthesis
	- Flucytosine
		- **MOA of flucytosine**
			- First metabolised into 5-flurouracil which is further metabolised into metabolites that can incorporate into DNA and RNA
			- This inhibits DNA synthesis
### Guidelines for antimicrobial management of urinary tract infections
- Empirical therapy for urinary tract infections
	- ![[Hong Kong guidelines for empirical therapy of urinary tract infections#Hong Kong guidelines for empirical therapy of urinary tract infections]]Note that cotrimoxazole, nitrofurantoin and nalidixic acid is not recommended for infants
