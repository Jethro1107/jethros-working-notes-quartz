- [[IAS70 Chronic Inflammation]]
	- Robbins Chapter 3: Chronic inflammation
		- Definition of chronic inflammation
			- Chronic inflammation is a response of prolonged duration (weeks or months) in which inflammation, tissue injury and attempts at reapir coexist, invarying combination
		- Cause of chronic inflammation
			- Persistent infections (those that evoke T4HS reaction)
			- Hypersensitivity disease
			- Prolonged exposure to insoluble particles
		- Morphologic features of chronic inflammation
			- 1. Infiltration with mononuclear cells - macrophages, lymphocytes and plasma cells
			- 2. Tissue destruction, induced by the persistent offending agent, or **by the inflammatory cells**
			- 3. Attempts at healing by formation of granulation tissue and in particular, fibrosis
		- Cells and mediators of chronic inflammation
			- Macrophages
				- Origin of macrophages in chronic inflammation
					- Recruitment from circulating monocytes and transformation into macrophages
					- Proliferation and immobilization of local macrophages
				- Role of macrophages in chronic inflammation
					- Classically activated macrophages (M1)
						- Activated by T-cell derived signals (interferon-gamma), resulting in increased production of ROS, inducible NO synthase, phagolysosome maturation and MHC Class II protein
						- Responsible for **elimination of microbe and T activation**
						- Also responsible for much of the tissue damage in chronic inflammation
					- Alternatively activated macrophages
						- Activated by IL-4, IL-13, responsible for **repair** by secreting IL-10, TGF-10, PDGF, FGF
			- Lymphocytes
				- Activated macrophages secret IL-1 and TNF to recruit lymphocytes, and activate lymphocyte by antigen presentation
				- Activated T cells can recruit circulating monocytes by releasing cytokines, and activate macrophages via classical pathway by release of INF-gamma
				- Bidirectional interaction between lymphocytes and macrophages plays an important role in propagating chronic inflammation
