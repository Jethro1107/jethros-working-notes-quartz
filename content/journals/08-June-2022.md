- [[CPRS PBL Case 1 - Obstructive sleep apnea]]
	- Sleep cycle and breathing control mechanisms in adults
		- There are 5 stages within a sleep cycle: S1, S2, S3, S4 and REM sleep, where after one falls asleep, S1 to REM sleep and back to S1 (light sleep -> Deep sleep   -> REM sleep -> Light sleep / Non-REM sleep -> REM sleep -> REM sleep)
		- ![[CPR09-10 Control of Breathing I & II#^69a078|Pattern and control mechanisms of breathing in wakefulness-sleep state]]
		- {{embed ((6299b877-d456-46b9-b5f3-19795bec1f44)) }}
		- Light sleep (S1 and S2): The individual drifts in and out of sleep and can be easily be woken up. It is characterised by slow eye movement and muscle movement
		- Deep sleep (S3 and S4): The individual is in deep sleep, and is very difficult to be waken up. It is characterised by no eye movement and muscle movement.
		- REM sleep: Characterised by rapid eye movement, and elevations in brain activity (where vivid dreams are formed, memory established etc.)
		- Usually an individual experience 3-5 REM periods a night, where the first REM period is short, and increases as the night goes on
		- Infants spend half of their time in REM sleep, but percentage of time spent in REM sleep declines
	- Snoring (OSA or not OSA) is a result of partial upper airway obstruction by different anatomical components of the upper respiratory tract
		- Nasal cavity - nasal congestion, deviated nasal septum may result in partial obstruction
		- Oropharynx - soft palate, uvula, tongue falls back in supine position, where it partially obstructs airway. Increase in bulk of throat tissues, i.e. during infection or in children (large tonsils) or obesed can also partially obstruct airway
		- Laryngopharynx - Enlarged lingual tonsils or epiglottis
		- ![[Pasted image 20220608122818.png]]
		- Deep sleep, use of sleeping pills and alcohol consumption results in decreased muscle tone of tongue and throat, which may result in snoring ^ed8610
	- Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)
		- What is sleep apnea?
			- ![[CPR09-10 Control of Breathing I & II#^b43197]]
		- Pathophysiology and clinical features of sleep apnea
			- Hypoxemia due to apneas is central to all clinicopathological manifestations of OSA (with the exception of snoring, which is caused by airway obstruction)
			- One might say airway obstruction is the upstream cause of all manifestations of OSA
			- Snoring - caused by partial airway obstruction
			- Jerking movements during sleep - caused by arousal
			- Daytime sleepiness - caused by arousal ==(arousal is caused by a surge in circulating catacholamines that puts an individual back in light sleep or even awakening states?)==
			- Hypertension - due to increased adrenergic drive due to sympathetic stimulation of arrousal
			- Polycynthemia, pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure - Chronic hypoxemia-mediated complications
		- Polysomnography (overnight sleep study) is a comprehensive test for the diagnosis of sleep disorders
			- Many different parameters are measured:
				- EEG
				- pulse oximetry
				- Eye movements
				- Chin movements
				- Leg movements (any jerking movements?)
				- Microphone - for snoring
				- ECG (heart rate)
				- Airflow
				- Thoracic belt and abdominal belt
					- thoracic and abdominal waves showed opposing movement due to paradoxical breathing
					- paradoxical breathing is when the diaphragm moves up instead of down during inhalation, this does not allow for the lungs to inhale in as much oxygen
					- there is still movement of both thoracic and abdomen during time points of no air flow, this eliminates central sleep apnea as the diagnosis as during central sleep apnea the CNS will not be able to signal for the diaphragmâ€™s movement
		- Management of sleep apnea
			- CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) is a device that maintains positive airway pressure to maintain a patent airway for continous airflow
			- Sleep apnea is also managed by treating the underlying causes:
				- Obesity - exercise, weight loss
				- Diet - reduce alcohol consumption ([[#^ed8610|Deep sleep, use of sleeping pills and alcohol consumption results in decreased muscle tone of tongue and throat, which may result in snoring]])
				- Surgery may be warranted if there are anatomical deficits that require correction
		- Complications of untreated sleep apnea
			- Hypertension (due to elevated adrenergic drive) is associated with a host of cardiovascular and renal complications
			- Daytime sleepiness increases the risk of traffic accidents

	- [[Pathophysiology of pneumonia]]
		- Decrease in surface area -> Diffusion impairments
		- VQ mismatching - caused uneven epithelial and endothelial damage
	- Pneumonia is [[Restrictive lung disease]]
		- Restrictive lung disease, a problem with inspiration, contrasting obstructive lung disease, which is a problem with expiration
		- FEV1 and FVC is both reduced where decrease in FVC is greater than FEV1, hence, FEV1/FVC ratio increase (>80%)
