- [[IAS72 Acute inflammation]]
	- The sole aim of inflammation is to deliver host defense agents and neutrophils to site of injury
	- Notes from Robbins Chapter 3: Inflammation and repair
	- What is inflammation?
		- Inflammation is a physiological response to tissue injury, not the disease itself
		- **Inflammation is a response of vascularized tissues that delivers leukocytes and molecules of host defense from the circulation to the sites of infection and cell damage in order to eliminate the offending agents.** 
	- Cause of inflammation
		- Infections
		- Tissue neecrosis
		- Foreign bodies
		- Immune reactions
	- Components of acute inflammation
		- **Acute inflammation has three major components:**
		- (1) dilation of small vessels leading to an increase in blood flow; 
			- Effects of vasodilation in acute inflammation
				- Changes in Vascular Flow and Caliber
					Changes in vascular flow and caliber begin early after injury and consist of the following.
					- _Vasodilation_ is induced by the action of several mediators, notably histamine, on vascular smooth muscle. It is one of the earliest manifestations of acute inflammation. Vasodilation first involves the arterioles and then leads to opening of new capillary beds in the area. The result is increased blood flow, which is the cause of heat and redness (erythema) at the site of inflammation.
					    
					- Vasodilation is quickly followed by _increased permeability of the microvasculature,_ with the outpouring of protein-rich fluid into the extravascular tissues; this process is described in detail later.
					    
					-  The loss of fluid and increased vessel diameter lead to slower blood flow, concentration of red cells in small vessels, and increased viscosity of the blood. These changes result in engorgement of small vessels with slowly moving red cells, a condition termed _stasis,_ which is seen as vascular congestion and localized redness of the involved tissue.
					    
					- As stasis develops, blood leukocytes, principally neutrophils, accumulate along the vascular endothelium. At the same time, endothelial cells are activated by mediators produced at sites of infection and tissue damage and express increased levels of adhesion molecules. Leukocytes then adhere to the endothelium, and soon afterward they migrate through the vascular wall into the interstitial tissue in a sequence that is described later.
		- (2) increased permeability of the microvasculature enabling plasma proteins and leukocytes to leave the circulation; and
			- Increased Vascular Permeability (Vascular Leakage)
				Several mechanisms are responsible for the increased permeability of postcapillary venules, a hallmark of acute inflammation ( [Fig. 3.3](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0020) ).
				-   _Contraction of endothelial cells_ resulting in opening of interendothelial gaps is the most common mechanism of vascular leakage. It is elicited by histamine, bradykinin, leukotrienes, and other chemical mediators. It is called the immediate transient response because it occurs rapidly after exposure to the mediator and is usually short-lived (15 to 30 minutes). In some forms of mild injury (e.g., after burns, irradiation or ultraviolet radiation, and exposure to certain bacterial toxins), vascular leakage begins after a delay of 2 to 12 hours and lasts for several hours or even days; this delayed prolonged leakage may be caused by contraction of endothelial cells or mild endothelial damage. Sunburn is a classic example of damage that results in late-appearing vascular leakage. Often the immediate and delayed responses occur along a continuum.
	    
				- _Endothelial injury_ resulting in endothelial cell necrosis and detachment. Direct damage to the endothelium is encountered in severe physical injuries, for example, in thermal burns, or is induced by the actions of microbes and microbial toxins that damage endothelial cells. Neutrophils that adhere to the endothelium during inflammation may also injure endothelial cells and thus amplify the reaction. In most instances leakage starts immediately after injury and is sustained for several hours until the damaged vessels are thrombosed or repaired.

				Although these mechanisms of increased vascular permeability are described separately, all probably contribute in varying degrees in responses to most stimuli. For example, at different stages of a thermal burn, leakage results from chemically mediated endothelial contraction and direct and leukocyte-dependent endothelial injury. The vascular leakage induced by these mechanisms can cause life-threatening loss of fluid in severely burned patients.
		- (3) emigration of leukocytes from the microcirculation, their accumulation in the focus of injury, and their activation to eliminate the offending agent
