- CPRS Embryology (Key terms)
	- Development of the heart
		- Partitioning of heart fields
			- The heart originates from the splanchnic meosoderm
			- The primary heart feild is a cluster of progenitor heart cells arranged in a horseshoe arrangement, craniolaterally
			- The primary heart feild gives rise to parts of the atrium and the entire left ventricle
			- The secondary heart field is derived from some cells of the primary heart field and ventral to the pharynx
			- The secondary heart field gives rise to portions of the atrium, the right ventricle and parts of the outflow tract (condus cordis and truncus arteriosus)
		- Formation and positioning of heart tubes
			- Formation of heart tube
				- 2 Endocardial tubes formed lateral to the notochord
				- During lateral body folding, endocardial tubes fuse to give heart tube

			- Positioning of heart tube
				- Cranial caudal folding pushes the primitive heart tube and the pericardial cavity towards the cervical region and then the thorax

			- Components of primitive heart tube
				- Truncus arteriosus - outflow tract
				- Bulbus cordis - right ventricle and outflow
				- Primitive ventricle - left ventricle
				- Primitive atrium - left and right atrium

		- Cardiac looping
			- Cranial portion of heart tube (ventricles and outflow tract) bend ventrocaudally and to the right
			- Caudal portion of heart tube (atria) bend dorsocranially and to the left

			- Abnormality in cardiac looping can result in dextrocardia
