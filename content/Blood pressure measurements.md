# Blood pressure measurements
### Clinical skills - Blood pressure measurement by auscultatory method (Korotkov sounds)
-   Tools required in blood pressure measurements:
    
    Sphygmomanometer and a stethoscope
-   **Procedure:**
    
    **Obtaining estimated systolic blood pressure**
    
    1.  Palpate for radial pulse
    2.  Apply cuff of appropriate size after removing tight clothing:
        -   Never measure blood pressure over clothing
        -   Centre cuff over brachial artery
        -   Lower edge of cuff around 2cm above antecubital fossa
        -   Adjust tubbing to avoid interference with auscultation
    3.  While palpating the radial pulse, inflate the cuff until radial pulse disappears, this is the estimated systolic pressure
    4.  Deflate the cuff completely
    
    **Obtaining systolic and diastolic blood pressure**
    
    1.  Place diaphragm of stethoscope **gently** over the brachial pulse
    2.  Inflate the cuff to 30mmHg above the estimated systolic pressure
    3.  Slowly deflate the cuff at a pace of 2-3 mmHg per seconds
    4.  Systolic and diastolic pressure is measured using Korotkov sounds:
        -   Systolic pressure is recorded when there is clear, repetitive tapping for 2 consecutive beats ([Phase 2 of Korotkov sound](https://www.notion.so/Blood-Pressure-Measurement-3603166fc87e4f30bedf30a46a480087))
        -   Diastolic pressure is recorded at the cessation of the tapping sound ([Phase 5 of Korotkov sound](https://www.notion.so/Blood-Pressure-Measurement-3603166fc87e4f30bedf30a46a480087))
    5.  Deflate the cuff completely when the readings are recorded
-   **Causes of overestimation of blood pressure**
    
    1.  Cuff bladder too narrow
    2.  Cuff applied too loosely
    3.  Cuff not centred over brachial artery
    4.  Arm held below heart level
    5.  Talking
    6.  Standing - Slight increase in diastolic pressure
    7.  Arm unsupported, causing isometric exercise of limb muscles
    8.  White coat hypertension
-   **Causes of underestimation of blood pressure**
    
    1.  Cuff bladder too wide
    2.  Leaking of tubing
    3.  Heavy pressure on stethoscope over artery underestimates diastolic blood pressure
    4.  Arm held above heart level
### Physiological basis of Korotkov sounds
| Korotkof sound                    | Pressure                                               | Blood flow                                                                        |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Phase 1 - No sound                | Cuff pressure > Systolic pressure                      | No blood flow through artery                                                      |
| Phase 2 - regular tapping         | Cuff pressure = Systolic pressure                      | Turbulent, pulsatile blood flow occuring in a short period of a cardiac cycle     |
| Phase 3 - tapping and murmurs     | Systolic pressure > Cuff pressure > Diastolic pressure | Turbulent, pulstatile blood flow occuring in certain periods of the cardiac cycle |
| Phase 4 - softening of sound      | Cuff pressure = Diastolic pressure                     | Continuous blood flow is restored                                                 |
| Phase 5 - cessation of all sounds | Diastolic pressure > Cuff pressure                     | Laminar blood flow is restored                                                    |                                  |                                                        |                                                                                   |
