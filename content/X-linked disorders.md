# X-linked disorders
- X-linked disorders are disorders that involve genes on the [[X chromosome]], where males and females are affected
- X-link disorders mostly recessive and often affect males, as they only carry one [[X chromosome]]
- [[X-linked disorders]] can deviate from clear cut dominant or recessiveness due to [[Dosage compensation by X inactivation]]. This is why heterozygous females may develop the disorder.
