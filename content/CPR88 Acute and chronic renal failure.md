# CPR88: Acute and chronic renal failure
### Definition of acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease
- Acute kidney injury
	- **DIagnostic criteria for acute kidney injury**
		- AKI can be diagnosed when any one of the following is present:
			- Increase in serum creatinine by >= 0.3 mg/dL (>=26.5 micromoles/L) within 48 hours, or
			- Increase in serum creatinine to >= 1.5 times of baseline, which is known to have occured within the prior 7 days, or
			- Urine volume <0.5ml/kg/hour for 6 hours
	- **Classification system for severity of acute kidney injury**
		- RIFLE criteria makes use of SCr and UO to assess severity and define spectrum of progressive kidney injury as seen in AKI
		- **R**isk for kidney dysfunction - Increase in SCr to >=1.5 times of baseline or reduction of GFR by 25%, or UO <0.5ml/kg/hour for 6 hours
		- **I**njury to kidney - Increase in SCr to >=2 times of baseline or reduction of GFR by 50%, or UO <0.5ml/kg/hour for 12 hours
		- **F**ailure of kidney function - Increase in SCr to >= 3 times of baseline or reduction of GFR by 75%, or UO <0.3ml/kg/hour for 24 hours or anuria for 12 hours
		- **L**oss of kidney function - Complete loss of kidney function for >4 weeks
		- **E**nd stage renal disease - Complete loss of kidney function for >3 months

- Chronic kidney disease
	- **Definition of chronic kidney disease**
		- CKD is defined as kidney damage or persistent decline in renal functions (GFR <60/ml/min/1.73m2) for more than 3 months
		- Kidney damage refers to the finding of pathological abnormalities or markers of kidney damge (on blood tests, urine tests and imaging studies), such markers of damage include:
			- Albuminuria - by assessing albumin-to-creatinine ratio
			- Urinary sediment abnormalities - by presence of red or white cell casts in urine
			- Imaging abnormalities
			- Pathological abnormalities on renal biopsy
			- Kidney transplant - assumed to have kidney damage
	- **Staging of chronic kidney disease**
		- NKF KDOQI classification of KDI
			- Stage 1 - presence of kidney damage with GFR >=90ml/min/1.73m2
			- Stage 2 - presence of kidney damage with GFR 60-89 ml/min/1.73m2
			- Stage 3 - Moderate decrease in GFR (30-59 ml/min/1.73m2)
			- Stage 4 - Severe decrease in GFR (15-29 ml/min/1.73m2)
			- Stage 5 - kidney failure/ESRD (<15 ml/min/1.73m2) or treatment of dialysis

### Causes of renal dysfunction
- Pre-renal cause
	- **Common pre-renal causes of renal impairments**
		- Hypoperfusion - Hypovolemia shock, septic shock, cardiogenic shock
		- Renovascular disease - Renal artery stenosis, renal artery/vein thrombosis
- Intra-renal cause
	- **Common intra-renal cause of renal impairments**
		- Drug-induced nephrotoxicity
		- Glomerular disease - Diabetic nephropathy, glomerulonephritis, Hereditary nephropathy (e.g. Alports disease, Adult polycystic kidney disease)
		- Tubulointerstitial disease - Acute tubular necrosis, acute interstitial nephritis
- Post-renal cause
	- **Classification of post-renal cause of renal impairments by affected components of urinary tract**
		- Prostate
			- **Common prostate pathology causing renal impairments**
				- Benign prostatic hyperplasia - most common cause of hydronephrosis in men
				- Prostate cancer
		- Urethra
			- **Common urethral pathology causing renal impairments**
				- Urethral stenosis/strictures - from previous trauma or prolonged catheterization
		- Bladder
			- **Common bladder pathology causing renal impairments**
				- Bladder cancer - can cause bilateral ureteric obstruction
				- Bladder stones
		- Ureters
			- **Common ureteric pathoolgy causing renal impairments**
				- Extramural
					- Lymph node metastasis - compressing in ureters
					- Pregnancies
					- Post radiation fibrosis
					- Idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis
				- Intramural
					- Urolithiasis

### Clinical features and complications of renal failure
- **General symptoms of renal failure**
	- Malaise, anorexia, pruritis, nausea, vomiting
- **Urinary symptoms of renal failure**
	- Early stage - polyuria, nocturia
	- Late stage - anuria, oliguria
- **Cardiovascular symptoms and complications of renal failure**
	- Fluid retention - ankle oedema, pulmonary oedema, hypertension
	- Accelerated atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease
	- Complication - uremic pericarditis
- **Neurological symptoms and complications of renal failure**
	- Restless legs, hiccups
	- Complications - uremic encephalopathy (coma, seizures), carpel tunnel syndrome (beta-2 microglobulin amyloidosis)
- **Haematological symptoms and complications of renal failure**
	- Normocytic Normochromatic (NcNc) anaemia - due to reduced erythropoietin production
	- Bleeding tendancy - due to platelet dysfunction
- **Endocrine symptoms of renal failure**
	- Infertility, amonorrhea
	- Sexual dysfunction
	- Failure to thrive in children
	- Secondary/tertiary hyperthyroidism
	- Renal osteodystrophy
- **Common electrolyte and acid-base imbalance of renal failure**
	- Hyponatremia
	- Hyperkalemia
	- Hypocalcemia
	- Hyperphosphateia
	- Metabolic acidosis

### Management of CKD and ESRD
- **Management of CKD**
	- Treatment of underlying cause
	- Diet and lifestyle modifications
	- Blood pressure control and RAAS blockade
	- Avoid nephrotoxic agents and drugs
- **Management of ESRD**
	- Renal replacement therapy - Peritoneal dialysis, haemodialysis, kidney transplantation
	- Renal paliative care
