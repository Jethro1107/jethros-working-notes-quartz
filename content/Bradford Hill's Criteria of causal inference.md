# Bradford Hill's Criteria of causal inference
- One should feel more comfortable of infering causal relationships from an association when:
	- **Consistency** - the same association is drawn in different places and different samples
	- **Experiment** - Causation is more likely if association is drawn from a [[Evidence-based decision making MOC#^c0c00d|Randomised control trials]]
	- **Dose-response** - Greater response should yield greater outcome
	- **Strength** - A stronger association is more likely to be an association
	- **Temporality** - An exposure must occur before an outcome
	- **Coherence** - Conclusion drawn should not contradict prevailing knowledge
	- **Plausability** - The association may be explained by a biological mechanism
	- **Specificity** - The exposure affects specifically the outcome
	- **Analogy** - A causal-effect relationship is shown with a similar exposure and outcome
