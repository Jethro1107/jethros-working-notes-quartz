- ### Reabsorption and secretion in proximal tubule
- **Epithelial lining proximal convoluted tubule**
    
    - Simple cuboidal epithelium with prominant brush border
- **Function of proximal tubules**
    
    - Proximal tubules is the major site of reabsorption, involved in reabsorption of 70% of filtrate
    
    - Proximal tubular cells are involved in production of Vitamin D3 under the influence of parathyroid hormone
    
    - Tubular secretion
- **Reabsorption pathways**
    
    - Paracellular transport - movement through leaky tight junctions by diffusion
    
    - Transcellular transport - movement across the cells (reabsorption and secretion), by primary transport, secondary active transport and osmosis

- **Mechanism of reabsorption and secretion in proximal tubular cells**
    - Reabsorption of Na+, glucose and amino acids by means of primary and secondary active transport
        
        - Primary active transport:
        
        - Na-K exchange pump on basolateral membrane (supplied by mitochondria) pumps out 3 Na+ into interstitium and 2 K+ into tubular cells creates an electrochemical gradient to drive reabsorption by secondary active transport

        - Secondary active transport:
        
        - Na symport carrier proteins co-transports Na with glucose, amino acids, vitamins into proximal tubular cells. Energy released when Na is transported down the electrochemical gradient is used to transport the other substance against its concentration gradient
        
        - This results in an increase in concentration of glucose, amino acids and vitamins in the tubular cells, allowing glucose, amino acids and vitamin to leave via the basolateral membrane via facilated facilitated diffusion

    - Secondary active secretion
        
        - Sodium antiport carrier proteins, Na+/H+ exchange (NHE) couples Na+ entry into the tubular cells with counter-transport of H+ into the lumen, enabling secondary active secretion of H+

    - Reabsorption of water by osmosis mainly due to Na+ reabsorption
        
        - Active reabsorption of solutes from filtrates into peritubular capillaries makes peritubular capillaries hyperosmotic, resulting in reabsorption of water by osmosis
        
        - Reabsorption of water takes place via the transcellular route due to the presence of aquaporins, and paracellular route
        
    - Reabsorption of chloride, urea, and other solutes by passive diffusion
        
        - Water reabsorption by osmosis driven by Na+ reabsorption results in the increase in Cl- and urea in the filtrate, resulting in reabsorption via passive diffusion

    - Urine remains isotonic
    

- ### Distal tubules and tubuloglomerular feedback

- **Epithelial lining of distal convoluted tubule**
    
    - Simple cuboidal epithelium with sparse microvilli
    
- **Function of distal tubules**
    
    - Regulate glomerular blood flow and nephron functions by renin release
    
    - Regulate reabsorption and secretion under hormone influence, e.g. aldosterone (increase reabsorption of Na+ and K+ secretion), parathyroid hormone (increase Ca2+ reabsorption)
    
- **Juxtaglomerular apparatus in autoregulation of Glomerular Filtration Rate in decreased NaCl concentration in distal tubules**
    
    - Decreased NaCl concentration in distal tubules (indicator of decreased GFR) initiates macula densa cells to have two effects:
    
    - It stimulates vasodilation of afferent arterioles, increasing glomerular blood flow and increasing glomerular hydrostatic pressure, and hence restoring GFR
    
    - It stimulates release of renin by JG cells, converting angiotensinogen into angiotensin I, which is converted into angiotensin II by Angiotensin converting enzymes in the lungs. Angiiotension II stimulates vasoconstriction of efferent arterioles, thus preventing blood from leaving the glomerulus, increasing glomerular hydrostatic pressure, and hence, restoring GFR

    - Angiotensin II stimulates release of aldosterone by adrenal cortex, where aldosterone promotes Na+ reabsorption and secretion of K+
    
- **Juxtaglomerular apparatus in autoregulation of Glomerular filtration rate in increased NaCl concentration in distal tubules**
    
    - Increased NaCl concentration in distal tubules initiate macula densa cells to stimulate nearby extraglomerular mesangial cells to release Ca2+
    
    - Ca2+ spreads to VSMC in afferent arterioles to cause vasoconstriction, decreasing glomerular blood flow, thus decreasing glomerular hydrostatic pressure, and decreased glomerular filtration rate
    
    - Ca2+ also inhibits renin release, thus there is no angiotensin and aldosterone production
