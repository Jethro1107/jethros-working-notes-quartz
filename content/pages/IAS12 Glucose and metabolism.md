## Processing from exogenous supply
- Digestion of Starch
    - **Describe the digestive process in the mouth cavity**
        Salivary alpha-amylase cleaves alpha-1,4-glycosidic bonds in starch to give:
        Dextrins, Maltose, Maltotriose, Isomaltose
        Disaccharides such as lactose and sucrose is not cleaved during the process

        Isomaltose, maltose and maltotriose

- Uptake of monosaccharides by enterocytes
    - **Why are transporters used for the uptake of monosaccharides into enterocytes?**
        They are often polar, thus are repelled by the non-polar region of the phospholipid bilayers
    - **What transporters are used to transport glucose from intestinal lumen into enterocytes?**
        SGLT1 (active transport) - Sodium-Glucose Linked Transporter 1 co-transports glucose and galactose with Na+ down the Na+ gradient generated by the sodium-potassium ATPase Pump

## Cellular fate of glucose
- **Commitment of glucose for metabolism after cellular uptake**
	- After cellular uptake of glucose, glucose is converted into glucose-6-phosphate
	- This is an irreversible reaction, trapping glucose within cells, comitting it to cellular metabolism
	![[Pasted image 20220518215416.png|375]] 
- **3 cellular fates of glucose**
	- Glycolysis
		- **Overview of glycolysis**
			![[Pasted image 20220518220032.png]]
		- **Net ATP generation of glycolysis**
			- Net production of 2 ATP
		- **Two types of glycolysis**
			-  Anaerobic glycolysis
				- **Pathway of anaerobic glycolysis**
					- In the absence of oxygen, pyruvate is converted into lactate by lactic dehydrogenase-A (LDH-A), using 2 NADH
					- Lactate is exported from the cell by monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)
					![[Pasted image 20220518220413.png]]
				- **2 Fates of lactate**
					- Lactate can be taken up by cardiac muscles and resting skeletal muscles, where they are converted into pyruvate and fed into the TCA cycle
					- Lactate from anaerobic glycolysis by muscles, erythrocytes or other cells can return to the liver, where they are converted into pyruvate for gluconeogenesis
					- This establishes the Cori cycle, where the glucose is released to be metabolised by red blood cells
						![[Pasted image 20220518220708.png]]
			- Aerobic glycolysis
				- **Pathway of aerobic glycolysis**
					- Pyruvate is converted into acetyl-CoA and is fed into the TCA cycle, and then the electron transport train
	- Pentose-phosphate pathway
		- Pathway of pentose phosphate pathway
			![[Pasted image 20220518221319.png|375]]
		- **Function of pentose phosphate pathway**
			The pentose phosphate pathway yields NADPH and pentose phosphate
			Pentose phosphate - required for nucleotide synthesis
			NADPH - required for biosynthesis (as a reducing agent) and to reduce oxidative damage
	- Conversion to UDP-glucose (an intermediate of glycogenesis)
		- **Pathway of glycogenesis**
			Glucose-6-phosphate is converted into glucose-1-phosphate by isomeric rearrangement
			Glucose-1-phosphate is then converted into UDP-glucose, which is then converted into glycogen
		- **Function of UDP-glucose**
			Glycogenesis
			Synthesis of glucuronides
			Synthesis of glycoproteins, glycolipids and proteoglycans
			Synthesis of other sugars - Glucose and galactose are inconvertible when attached to UDP, and UDP-galactose can be used for lactose synthesis
