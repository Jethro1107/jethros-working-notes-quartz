# CPR02: Anatomy of the chest wall

### Thoracic Cage
- What are the functions of the thoracic cage?
    1. To **protect** internal organs (heart, lungs) and great vessels (aorta, superior vena cava)
    2. To provide surfaces for **attachment** of muscles such as intercostal muscles, pectoralis major, minor, scalene muscles and sternocleidomastoid muscle
- Describe the anatomy of the thoracic cage.
    The skeleton of the thoracic wall forms an osteocartilaginous thoracic cage, which includes:
    
    12 pairs of **ribs** and **costal cartilages**,
    12 **thoracic vertebrae** and intervertebral discs,
    The **sternum**
    
    (Moore’s Essential Clinical Anatomy p.52)
- What are the different type of ribs and how do they articulate anteriorly to the sternum?
    True ribs (First 7 of the 12 ribs):
    - so-called because they **attach directly** to the sternum through their **own costal cartilages** (i.e. They have their own costal cartilages)
    
    False ribs (8th to 10th ribs):
    - [Their costal cartilages attach to the cartilage of the rib just superior to them](CPR02%20Anatomy%20of%20the%20chest%20wall%20ced7849500ce4b468a3bdc812aea1f15/False%20Ribs%20Attachment%20d1a8b102334f48899cf4ead0a4b58984.md); thus **their connection to the sternum is indirect**
    
    Floating ribs (11th and 12th ribs):
    - Their costal cartilage **do not connect** even indirectly with the sternum
    
    (Moore’s Essential Clinical Anatomy p.52)
- Describe the structures of typical ribs and their functions.
    Typical rib - 3rd to 9th rib, consist of a head, a neck, a tubercle and a body
    
    **Head** - Consist of 2 articular facets separated by the crest of the head, one for articulating with the numerically corresponding thoracic vertebrae and the other for articulating with the vertebra superior to it (i.e. One facet of 2nd rib articulate with T2, and other for T1)
    
    **Neck** - at the level of the tubercle, connects head with body
    
    Tubercle - Above the neck, consist of an articular facet for articulating with the corresponding transverse process of the vertebra
    
    **Body (shaft)** - Thin, flat and curved, marked at the angle where the rib turns anterolaterally
    
    The concave internal surface of the body has a costal groove which contains the neurovascular bundle with the intercostal vein, artery and nerve (VAN)
    
    Distal end of the articulate with costal cartilage anteriorly
- Describe the structures of the sternum and their functions.
    The sternum consist of three structures - The **Manubrium**, the **body**, and the **Xiphoid** **process**
    
    The **manubrium** consist of articular sites for clavicles  (2 Clavicular Notch separated by a jugular notch)
    
    The **manubrium** consist of an articulate facet for the first rib, which is a **cartilaginous joint**
    
    The **body** articulates with the **manubrium** to form the **manubriosternal joint** at around T4/T5, forming the sternal angle
    
    The second rib articulates to the sternum at the articular demifacets between the menubrium and the body
    
    On the **body**, articular facets are found for rib 3 to 6, which are **synovial joint**
    
    The distal end of the **body** articulates with the **xiphoid process** to form the **xiphisternal joint**
    
    Between the body and xiphoid process, articular facets are found for rib 7, which is also a **synovial joint**
    
    **Costal cartilages** are hyaline cartilages connect the first 7 ribs to the lateral parts of the sternum, and the 8th, 9th and 10th rib to the costal cartilage immediately above (i.e. the 7th costal cartilage)
- Describe how ribs articulate posteriorly to the thoracic vertebrae.
    Costovertebral joint - The 2 articular facets of the **head** of the rib articulate to 2 vertebrae, one articulate to the numerically corresponding vertebrae (i.e. one articular facet of 2nd rib articulate to T2), and the other articulates to the superior vertebrae
    
    Costotransverse joint - The articular facets of the tubercles of the rib articulates to the costal facets on their transverse processes
    
    **Both are synovial joints, allowing free movement**
- Describe the movement of the chest wall during inspiration.
    When intercostal muscles contract, movement of the ribs at the costovertebral joint causes the anterior end of the ribs to rise, causing the anterior posterior diameter (AP) to increase (pump-handle movement)
    
    When intercostal muscles contract, the middle of the ribs raise, causing the transverse diameter (TD) to increase (bucket handle movement)

### Structures of Intercostal Space
- List the contents of intercostal space.
    1. External intercostal muscle (Active in inspiration)
    2. Internal intercostal muscle (Active in exhalation)
    3. Innermost intercostal muscle 
    4. Thoracis transversus muscle/Sternocostalis (Cross more than one intercostal space)
    5. Subcostalis (Cross more than one intercostal space)
- What is the function of the intercostal muscles?
    To elevate and depress the thoracic cage
- Describe the direction of the external and internal intercostal muscle.
    External intercostal muscle:
    Progresses posteriorly to anteriorly, where at the sternum, it becomes the external intercostal membrane
    
    Internal intercostal muscle:
    Progresses anteriorly to posteriorly, where at the vertebra, it becomes the internal intercostal membrane

### Blood Supply of Thoracic Cage
- Describe the arterial supply of the chest wall.
    **Posterior IC arteries:**
    In the 1st and 2nd intercostal space, the posterior intercostal arteries are derived from the supreme (or superior) intercostal artery, derived from the subclavian artery
    
    In the 3rd to 11th intercostal space, the posterior intercostal arteries are derived directly from the thoracic aorta
    
    Subcostal artery derived from the thoracic aorta provides arterial supply below the 12th rib
    
    **Anterior IC arteries:**
    In the 1st to 6th intercostal space, the anterior intercostal arteries are derived from the internal thoracic artery (ITA), which is derived from the subclavian artery
    
    In the 7th to 9th intercostal space, the anterior intercostal arteries are derived from the musculophrenic artery, a terminal branch of the internal thoracic artery, that supplies the 7th to 9th anterior intercostal arteries and the diaphragm
    
    - What is the other terminal branch of the internal thoracic artery?
        The superior epigastric artery, which supplies the rectus abdominis muscle   
- Describe the venous supply of the chest wall.
    **Right Posterior IC veins:**
    In the 1st and 2nd right intercostal space, the right posterior intercostal veins drain into the right superior intercostal veins, which eventually drain into the azygos vein
    
    In the 3rd to 11th right intercostal space, the right posterior intercostal veins drain directly into the azygos vein
    
    **Left Posterior IC veins:**
    In the 1st and 2nd left intercostal space, the left posterior intercostal veins drain into the left superior intercostal vein, which drains into the left brachiocephalic vein or acessory hemiazygos vein
    
    In the 3rd to 11th left intercostal space, the left posterior intercostal veins drain into the hemiazygos vein
    
    The subcostal vein also drains into the hemiazygos vein
    
    Both the hemiazygos vein and the accessory hemiazygos vein eventually drain into the azygos vein
    
    **Anterior IC veins:**
    In the 1st to 6th intercostal space, the anterior intercostal veins directly drain into the internal thoracic vein
    
    In the 7th to 9th intercostal space, the anterior intercostal veins drain into the musculophrenic vein, which drain into the internal thoracic vein subsequently
