- # Classical 'Sangar' dideoxy sequencing
- Sangar sequencing is used for sequencing of DNA sequences of 500-800bp
- It is invented by [[Frederick Sangar]] in 1977
- [[Principles of Sangar sequencing]]
	- Sangar sequencing is based on the principle that 3'OH is required for DNA elongation
	- ((629afe7e-c1d4-46e0-8606-e4e7f9c47204))
	- It involves amplification of DNA, where dNTP (deoxynucleotides) is mixed with ddNTP (dideoxynucleotides)
	- When ddNTP is incorporated into the growing nucleotide chain, it results in chain termination due to the lack of 3'OH
	- This results in formation sequences of different sizes, which can be separated by gel electrophoresis to work out the sequence
