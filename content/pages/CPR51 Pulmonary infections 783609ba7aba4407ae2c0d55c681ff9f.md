### Pneumonia
- Bacterial pneumonia
	- **Common bacteria causing pneumonia**
	    
	    Streptocccus
	    
	    Staphylococcus
	    
	    Haemophilus
	    
	    Pseudomonas
	    
	    Klebsiella
	- **Pathogenesis of bacterial pneumonia**
	    
	    Inhalation of infectious droplets into the lung, resulting in deposition of bacteria in bronchial tree
	    
	    Bacteria proliferates after deposition to form a colony
	    
	    Alveolar macrophages detect presence of bacteria, releasing chemotaxic factors for recruitment of neutrophils into alveolar space, triggering tissue inflammation
	- **Morphological changes/pathology of bacterial pneumonia**
	  id:: 62a0493c-702c-44ba-b0bb-acfdc22447d0
	    Early stage: Congestion and oedema (associated with ((62a0494b-58eb-47eb-83e1-26f297880238)) )
	    Congestion of capillaries and exudate filling up the alveolar space
	    
	    Intermediate stage: Consolidation
	    Alveolar space fills up with neutrophils, forming solidification (replacement of air by exudates) of the lungs
	    
	    Late stage: Resolution or complications
	    Resolution - infection controlled and inflammation subsides
	    Complications - destruction of lung parenchyma/spread of infection
	     ^8f91b5
	- **2 patterns of anatomical distribution of bacterial pneumonia**
	    
	    Bronchopneumonia - Patchy, bilateral multifocal consolidations centered around the terminal bronchioles (when severe, can be confluent and lobar-like)
	    
	    Lobar pneumonia - Diffuse consolidations of whole/part of the lobe of the lung, lobe becomes liver like

	     ^c2c826
	- **Clinical presentation of bacterial pneumonia (signs and symptoms, CXR presentation)**
	    
	    Systematic signs and symptoms:
	    
	    Fever, malaise (due to cytokine effect e.g. IL-1, TNF-alpha)
	    
	    Respiratory symptoms:
	    
	    Productive cough with yellow-green sputum (purulent exudates)
	    
	    Shortness of breath in severe cases
	    
	    Chest pain if pleura is involved (due to presence of nerve fibres)
	    
	    Bronchial breath sounds (Ref: [Bronchial and Vesicular Breath Sounds - YouTube - Stanford Medicine 25](https://www.notion.so/Bronchial-and-Vesicular-Breath-Sounds-YouTube-Stanford-Medicine-25-a46136f26ade410081b2f5f7a2e26160))
	    
	    Crepitations on inspiration (due to air passing through exudate)
	    
	    CXR presentation:
	    
	    Patchy or diffuse whitish shadows (consolidations)

	- **Predisposing factors of bacterial pneumonia**
	    
	    Virulent organism exposure
	    
	    Immunocomprimised patients - DM patients, cancer, organ transplant patients etc.
	    
	    Impaired airway clearance - Smoking (immobile cilia), depressed cough reflex, immobile cilia apparatus
	    
	    Lung congestion and oedema, accumulation of secretions - facilitate bacterial growth
	    
	    General poor health and malnutrition - alcoholic, old age, malnutrition
	- **Outcomes of bacterial pneumonia**
	    
	    Uncomplicated - total resolution returning to normal lung
	    
	    Complications:
	    
	    1. Destruction of lung parenchyma
	        
	        Organization and fibrosis in airspace - fibroblasts grow into alveolar space, resulting in deposition of collagen

	        Lung abcess formation
		- **What is a lung abscess?**
		    
		    Lung abscess refers to a localized area of suppurative necrosis within the pulmonary parenchyma, resulting in the formation of one or more large cavities
		    
		    ![Untitled](CPR51%20Pulmonary%20infections%20783609ba7aba4407ae2c0d55c681ff9f/Untitled%202.png)
		    
		          2. Spread of infection
		  
		              Spread to adjacent organs - pleuritis, pericarditis, empyema thoracis
		  
		              Distant spread - meningitis, arthritis etc.
		- **What is empyema thoracis?**
		    
		    Empyema thoracis is the collection of pus within the pleural space due to spread of infection from lung
		    
		    On gross anatomy, yellowish pus covers the lung surface

- Interstitial pneumonitis
	- **Pathogenesis of interstitial pneumonitis**
	    
	    Virons infect epithelial cells and interstitial cells of the lung interstitium (alveolar wall, peribronchial and peribronchiolar tissue)
	    
	    This triggers inflammation, resulting in congestion of capillaries and infiltration of mononuclear inflammatory cells into interstitium(macrophages, lymphocytes, plasma cells)
	- **Morphological changes/pathology of interstitial pneumonitis**
	    
	    Exudate with mononuclear inflammatory cells infiltrate into interstitium
	    
	    ![Untitled](CPR51%20Pulmonary%20infections%20783609ba7aba4407ae2c0d55c681ff9f/Untitled%204.png)
	- **Clinical features of interstitial pneumonitis**
	    
	    Systemic symptoms:
	    
	    Fevers, malaise (due to cytokine effect)
	    
	    Respiratory symptoms:
	    
	    Non productive cough with minimal sputum (due to minimal exudates into alveolar space)
	    
	    Alveolocapillary block, causing diffusion impairments, hypoxia and shortness of breath
	- **Outcomes of interstitial pneumonitis**
	    
	    Uncomplicated - Total resolution with normal lung
	    
	    Complications:
	    
	    Organization and fibrosis
		- Diffuse alveolar damage (death)
			- **Pathogenesis of diffuse alveolar damage**
			    
			    Epithelial cell injury is detected by alveolar macrophages, which release inflammatory factors (IL-1, TNF-alpha, IL-8) for endothelial activation and recruitment of neutrophils
			    
			    Activated neutrophils enter interstitium and alveoli, releasing destructive products (ROS, protease) that damage the epithelium and endothelium
			    
			    Fibrin rich exudates entering alveoli and necrotic epithelial cells reorganize into hyaline membrane
			    
			    Type II pneumocytes proliferate to line the alveolar wall
			- **Histological features of diffuse alveolar damage**
			    
			    Hyaline membrane consisting of fibrin-rich exudates and necrotic debris
			    
			    Type II pneumocyte hyperplasia lining alveolar wall
			    
			    Interstitial oedema with predominant mononuclear infiltrates

	- **What is tuberculosis?**
	    
	    Tuberculosis is the chronic inflammation caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis
	- **Microorganism causing tuberculosis and staining properties**
	    
	    Mycobacterium tuberculosis
	    
	    It is an acid-fast bacilli, which enables it to resist acid decolorization during Ziehl-Neelsen stain
	- Pathogenesis of tuberculosis
	    
	    Ref: [Robbins: Pathogenesis of tuberculosis](https://www.notion.so/Robbins-Pathogenesis-of-tuberculosis-35c51885e80a40ef8f81aebb4a6ede3d)
	- **Histopathological hallmarks of tuberculosis**
	    
	    Granulomatous inflammation:
	    
	    A focus of chronic inflammation consisting of microscopic aggregation of activated macrophages that are transformed into epitheloid cells, and langhanâ€™s giant cell surrounded by a collar of mononucleated leukocytes, principally lymphocytes and occasionally mast cells
	    
	    Central caseous necrosis is present
	    
	    ![Untitled](CPR51%20Pulmonary%20infections%20783609ba7aba4407ae2c0d55c681ff9f/Untitled%207.png)

	    Secondary tuberculosis:
	    
	    Re-infection or re-activation of latent MTB in previously sensitized individual
	    
	    Results in type IV hypersensitivity reaction with granuloma formation
	    
	    Milliary tuberculosis:
	    
	    Systemic spread, resulting in many granuloma formation
- Opportunistic infections
	- **What is opportunistic infection?**
	    
	    Infections caused by microorganisms that are not pathogenic in healthy immunocompetent patients, but are severe and life-threatening to immunocomprimised patients
	- Pneumocystis jirovecii
		- **What is pneumocystis jirovecii?**

		    Alveolar cast - frosty sputum, with ball like exudates detected by broncho-alveolar lavage
### Bronchiectasis
- **What is bronchiectasis?**
    
    Bronchietasis - the permanent dilation of bronchi and bronchiioles caused by destruction of smooth muscles and supporting elastic tissue
- **Pathogenesis of bronchiectasis**
    
    Bronchiectasis is caused by two processes: obstruction and infection
    
    Bronchial obstruction impairs airway clearance, which predisposes to infection
    
    Infection results in weakening and scarring in bronchial wall
    
    Infection may also impair airway clearance, resulting in a obstruction
    
    During inhalation, the negative intrapulmonary pressure pulls on the weakened bronchial wall, causing segmental dilatation
    
    Ref: [Robbins: Pathogenesis of bronchiectasis](https://www.notion.so/Robbins-Pathogenesis-of-bronchiectasis-be7c9a244d6a436a94aecb19b591ef9a)
- **Morphological changes/pathology of bronchiectasis**
    
    Dilatation of airways
    
    Can be diffuse or local, depending on obstruction
    
    Local - tumor, aspirates, foreign bodies etc.
    
    Diffuse - Cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia

- **Clinical features of bronchiectasis**
    
    Reccurent episodes of pulmonary infections
    
    Copious, foul-smelling sputum associated with postural change
    
    Abcess formation
    
    Severe bronchiectasis may result in obstructive ventilatory defects:
    
    Hypoxemia, hypercapnia, pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale
