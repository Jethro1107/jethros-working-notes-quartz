Proceeding distally along the respiratory bronchioles, the number of alveolar openings in the bronchiolar wall slowly increases. Respiratory bronchioles branch into tubes
called **alveolar ducts** that are completely lined by the openings of alveoli (Figure 17–12). Both the alveolar ducts and the alveoli are lined with extremely attenuated
squamous alveolar cells. In the lamina propria surrounding the rim of the alveoli is a thin network of smooth muscle cells, which disappears at the distal ends of alveolar
ducts. A rich matrix of elastic and collagen fibers provides the only support of the duct and its alveoli.

Lung tissue has a spongy structure because of the abundant air passages and pockets called alveoli. **(a):** Typical section of lung tissue including many bronchioles, some of
which are respiratory bronchioles (RB) cut lengthwise, and showing the branching continuity with alveolar ducts (AD) and sacs (AS). Respiratory bronchioles still have a layer
of smooth muscle and some regions of cuboidal epithelium, but alveolar ducts have only sparse strands of smooth muscle and an epithelium consisting of only a series of
neighboring alveoli. The smooth muscle fibers are sphincter-like and appear as knobs between adjacent alveoli. Individual alveoli (A) all open to the sacs or ducts. The
respiratory bronchiole runs along a thin-walled branch of the pulmonary artery (PA), which has a relatively thin wall, while branches of the pulmonary vein (V) course
elsewhere in the parenchyma. X14. H&E.

**(b):** Higher magnification shows the relationship of the many rounded, thin-walled alveoli (A) to alveolar ducts (AD). Alveolar ducts end in two or more clusters of alveoli
called alveolar sacs (AS). Those alveoli shown here that do not show openings to the ducts or the sacs have their connections in adjacent planes of other sections. X140. H&E.

Alveolar ducts open into atria of two or more **alveolar sacs** (Figure 17–12). Elastic and reticular fibers form a network encircling the openings of atria, alveolar sacs,
and alveoli. The elastic fibers enable the alveoli to expand with inspiration and to contract passively with expiration. The reticular fibers serve as a support that prevents
overdistention and damage to the delicate capillaries and thin alveolar septa. Both fibers contribute to the connective tissue housing the network of capillaries around
each alveolus.
