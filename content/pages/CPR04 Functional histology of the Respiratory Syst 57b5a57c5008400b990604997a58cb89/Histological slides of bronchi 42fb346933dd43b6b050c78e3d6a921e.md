**Tertiary (segmental) bronchus.**

In a cross-section of a large bronchus the lining of respiratory epithelium (E) and the mucosa are folded due to contraction of its smooth muscle (SM). At this stage in the
bronchial tree, the wall is also surrounded by many pieces of hyaline cartilage (C) and contains many seromucous glands (G) in the submucosa which drain into the lumen.
In the connective tissue surrounding the bronchi can be seen arteries and veins (V), which are also branching as smaller and smaller vessels in the approach to the
respiratory bronchioles. All bronchi are surrounded by distinctive lung tissue (LT) showing the many empty spaces of pulmonary alveoli. X56. H&E.

**Bronchial wall.**

**(a):** A higher power view of the bronchus shows the epithelium (E) of mainly pseudostratified ciliated columnar cells with a few goblet cells. The lamina propria (LP) contains
the distinct layer of smooth muscle (SM) surrounding the entire bronchus. The submucosa is the site of the supporting cartilage (C) and the adventitia includes blood vessels
(V) and nerves (N). Lung tissue (LT) directly surrounds the adventitia of bronchi. X140. H&E. **(b):** This micrograph shows the epithelium of a smaller bronchus, in which the
epithelium is primarily of columnar cells with cilia (arrows), with fewer goblet cells. The lamina propria has both smooth muscle (SM) and small serous glands (G) near
cartilage (C). X400. H&E.

The lamina propria also contains elastic fibers and abundant mucous and serous glands (Figure 17â€“8) whose ducts open into the bronchial lumen. Numerous
lymphocytes are found both within the lamina propria and among the epithelial cells. Lymphatic nodules are present and are particularly numerous at the branching
points of the bronchial tree. Elastic fibers, smooth muscle, and MALT become relatively more abundant as bronchi become smaller and cartilage and other connective
tissue are reduced.
