In congestive heart failure, the lungs become congested with blood, and erythrocytes pass into the alveoli, where they are phagocytized by alveolar macrophages. In such cases, these macrophages are called **heart failure cells** when present in the lung and sputum; they are identified by a positive histochemical reaction for iron pigment (hemosiderin).

Increased production of type I collagen is common, and many diseases that lead to respiratory distress are known to be associated with lung fibrosis.
