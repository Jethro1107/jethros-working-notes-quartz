- Steps to sequencing by synthesis 
	- 1. DNA preparation - DNA sequence is primed with adaptors and barcodes
	- 2. Amplication - amplication of clusters of sequence
	- 3. Sequencing
		- Florescence-labelled and terminally blocked nucleotide is added
		- Flow cell is imaged to determine the base added
		- Florescence is cleaved to regenerate 3'OH, enable the addition of the next nucleotide
