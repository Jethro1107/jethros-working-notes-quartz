### The Central Dogma
- Learning Outcomes
    
    To describe the central dogma of molecular biology and recognize its centrality to medicine
    
    To illustrate the processes of transcription, mRNA processing, and translation
- **What is the Central Dogma?**
    The Central Dogma - A philosophy of molecular biology proposed by Francis Crick, illustrating the one way flow of information from DNA to RNA to Protein
    
    Viruses like HIV allows for the reverse transcription to occur, from RNA back to DNA
    
    However, information cannot be returned from protein back to nucleic acids

    ![Page17.jpg](IAS06%20Nucleic%20acids%20-%20DNA%20and%20RNA%2077cfddaf40b645d48ea1af21a69ffdb8/Page17.jpg)
- Transcription
	- **What are the steps of transcription?**
		- Initiation
		    Transcription factors bind to TATA box bind sequence, a specific sequence in the promotor region 25 to 35 bases upstream of the starting point of the gene, forming the mediator protein complex
		    
		    RNA polymerase binds to the DNA
		    
		    Mediator protein complex and RNA polymerase forms the transcription initiation complex
		    
		    Activation proteins in enhancer region thousands of bases away comes in contact with the initiation complex, activating the transcription initiation complex and triggering elongation
		- Elongation
		    RNA polymerase runs from 3' to 5' of the template strand, while elongation occurs from 5' to 3' of the nascent mRNA

		- Termination
- **RNA processing**

 ![Page22.jpg|375](IAS06%20Nucleic%20acids%20-%20DNA%20and%20RNA%2077cfddaf40b645d48ea1af21a69ffdb8/Page22.jpg)
	![Page23.jpg|375](IAS06%20Nucleic%20acids%20-%20DNA%20and%20RNA%2077cfddaf40b645d48ea1af21a69ffdb8/Page23.jpg)
	3 processes in RNA processing of primary transcript:
	1. 5' cap to stabilise the mRNA molecule
	2. 3' Poly (A) tail added (Polyadenylation)
	3. Removing introns by splcing
- **Translation**
    Ribosome run from 3' to 5' of mRNA molecule
    mRNA molecule and tRNA molecule is antiparallel, such that proteins are synthesized from a 5' to 3' direction

    ![Page28.jpg](IAS06%20Nucleic%20acids%20-%20DNA%20and%20RNA%2077cfddaf40b645d48ea1af21a69ffdb8/Page28.jpg)
### Regulation of Gene Expression
- Learning Outcomes
    
    To illustrate the packaging of DNA by histones into nucleosomes
- **Need for regulation of gene expression**
    Different genes are expressed in different cells and in different developmental stages
- **From DNA to chromatids**
    ![Page35.jpg](IAS06%20Nucleic%20acids%20-%20DNA%20and%20RNA%2077cfddaf40b645d48ea1af21a69ffdb8/Page35.jpg)
    
    4 types of core histone proteins - H2A, H2B, H3, H4
    DNA wrap around histone proteins twice to form a nucleosome
    Histone covalent modification (e.g acetylation) regulates gene expression as it results in structural changes in the cores, exposing the DNA to the polymerase
    ![Page36.jpg](IAS06%20Nucleic%20acids%20-%20DNA%20and%20RNA%2077cfddaf40b645d48ea1af21a69ffdb8/Page36.jpg)
- **Regulation of gene expression**
	- Gene expressions is regulated at multiple states:
		- Before transcription:
			- Histone covalent modification may initiate gene expression
			- Many transcription factors are required for gene expression (which may become complex, where multiple regulators complex with a mediator to activate RNA polymerase)

		- Postranscriptional regulation of gene expression:
			- Posttranscriptional processing e.g. RNA splicing
			- mRNA degradation
		- Posttranslational regulation of gene expression:
			- Posttranslational processing
			- Protein degradation
			- Protein targetting and trasport
