### Pulmonary gas diffusion

- **Law governing pulmonary gas diffusion**
    - Pulmonary gas diffusion is governed by Fick's Law, which states that the rate of gas transfer across a sheet varies directly with diffusion constant, surface area and transmembrane pressure gradient, and inversely with distance ![Untitled](app://local/Users/jethrolai/Desktop/Obsidian/Jethro's%20Vault/pages/CPR08%20Pulmonary%20gas%20diffusion%20and%20transport%2005a3b84fc8994a769692dc998b97c368/Untitled.png?1652399186000)
- **Factors affecting pulmonary gas diffusion**
    - Diffusion constant
        - **What is diffusion constant?**
            - Diffusion constant measures the diffusing properties of the membrane and that of the gas
        - **Factors affecting diffusion constant**
            - Diffusion constant varies inversely with the square root of molecular weight, and varies directly with solubility constant
        - **Comparison of diffusion constant of O2 and CO2 and its implications**
            - While molecular weight of O2 is smaller than that of CO2, the solubility constant of CO2 is 21 times greater than that of O2
            - Hence, the diffusion constant of CO2 is around 20 times that of O2
            - As a result, CO2 diffuses more rapidly than O2 across the respiratory membrane with equal surface area, thickness and transmembrane pressure gradient
    - Surface area
        - **Surface area in the context of pulmonary gas diffusion**
            - Surface area refers to the total area of functional alveoli in contact with capillary blood, or the effective surface area for diffusion
        - **Adaptive features of lung in terms of surface area facilitating pulmonary gas diffusion**
            - The surface area of the blood air barrier is enormous (50-100 sq m), which is ideal for rapid pulmonary gas diffusion
        - **How surface area may be decreased in disease conditions and its effects on pulmonary gas diffusion**
            - Emphysema - Causes a disruption in alveolar architecture
            - Pulmonary embolism - Causes a decrease in functional capillary bed
            - Obstructive disease - Causes a partial block in airway
            - These disease conditions cause a decrease in surface area, and hence a decrease in the rate of pulmonary gas diffusion
        - **How surface area may increase during exercise and its effects on pulmonary gas diffusion**
            - Increase in number of capillaries with active circulation (increases perfusion)
            - Dilation of functional capillaries (increase perfusion)
            - Increased ventilation resulting in increased surface area of functioning alveoli
            - This cause an increase in surface area, and hence an increase in the rate of pulmonary gas diffusion
    - Distance
        - **Distance in the context of pulmonary gas diffusion**
            - Distance refers to the thickness of the alveolo-capillary membrane (respiratory membrane)
        - **Adaptive feature of lung in terms of distance facilitating pulmonary gas diffusion**
            - The alveolo-capillary membrane is very thin (0.2-0.5 microns), which is ideal for rapid pulmonary gas diffusion
        - **How distance may increase in disease conditions and its effects on pulmonary gas diffusion**
            - Alveolar edema due to fluid retention in alveoli
            - Increase in thickness of alveolar wall due to pulmonary fibrosis
            - Increase in thickness of endothelial wall due to pulmonary fibrosis
            - Interstitial edema due to increased pulmonary blood pressures
            - This causes an increase in distance, and hence a decrease in the rate of pulmonary gas diffusion
        - **Alveolar capillary block?**
            
            Condition for longer pathway across the alveolo-capillary membrane resulting in decreased rate of pulmonary gas diffusion
            
    - Transmembrane pressure gradient
        - **What is transmembrane pressure gradient in the context of pulmonary gas diffusion?**
            - Transmembrane pressure gradient refers to the difference in partial pressure gradient across blood-air barrier
            - The greater the transmembrane pressure gradient, the greater the rate of pulmonary gas diffusion
            - For O2, it is the pressure difference between the alveolar PO2 and the capillary PO2
            - For CO2, it is the pressure difference between capillary PCO2 and alveolar PCO2
        - **Factors affecting transmembrane gradient**
            - Alveolar ventilation (affects alveolar gas pressures)
                - **Effects of increased alveolar ventilation on transmembrane pressure gradient**
                    - When alveolar ventilation increase, alveolar gas pressures approach that of inspired air
                    - This results in an increase in alveolar PO2 and a decrease in alveolar PCO2
                    - The transmembrane gradient for O2 and CO2 increase, thus increasing the rate of pulmonary gas diffusion
                - **Effects of decreased alveolar ventilation on transmembrane gradien**t
                    - When alveolar ventilation decrease, alveolar gas pressures approach that of venous blood
                    - This results in a decrease in alveolar PO2 and an increase in alveolar PCO2
                    - The transmembrane gradient for O2 and CO2 decrease, thus decreasing the rate of pulmonary gas diffusion
            - Pulmonary perfusion (affects capillary gas pressures)
                - **Effects of increased pulmonary perfusion on pulmonary gas diffusion**
                    - When pulmonary perfusion increase, capillary gas pressure approaches that of venous blood
                    - This results in a decrease in capillary PO2 and an increase in capillary PCO2
                    - The transmembrane pressure for O2 and CO2 increase, thus increasing the rate of pulmonary gas diffusion
                - **Effects of decreased pulmonary perfusion on pulmonary gas diffusion**
                    - When pulmonary perfusion increase, capillary gas pressure approach that of arterial blood
                    - This results in an increase in capillary PO2 and a decrease in capillary PCO2
                    - The transmembrane pressure gradient for O2 and CO2 decrease, thus decreasing the rate of pulmonary gas diffusion
            - Reaction with haemoglobin
                - **Effects on transmembrane pressure gradient of CO2**
                    - Hb acts as a source of CO2, such that capillary PCO2 remains high, maintaining a high transmembrane pressure gradient for CO2
                - **Effects on transmembrane pressure gradient of O2**
                    - Hb acts as a sink for O2, such that capillary PO2 remains low, maintaining a steep transmembrane pressure gradient for O2
- Pulmonary diffusion capacity
    - **What is pulmonary diffusion capacity?**
        - Pulmonary diffusion capacity varies proportionally with surface area and diffusion constant, and inversely with thickness
        - Pulmonary diffusion capacity refers to the minute volume of gas transfer across the alveolo-capillary membrane for a given partial pressure difference of 1mmHg
        - It is the measurement of the functional integrity of the respiratory membrane for gas transfer
    - **Deriving equation for pulmonary diffusion capacity**
        - Pulmonary diffusion capacity varies proportionally with surface area and diffusion constant, and inversely with thickness
        - Hence, Fick's equation can be written as:
        - 
        - Rearranging this equation gives:
        - 
        - The definition of pulmonary diffusion capacity is derived from the above equation
    - **How is pulmonary diffusion capacity measured clinically?**
        - Using the CO method to measure diffusion capacity for CO, then adjusting to find diffusion capacity of O2
        - DLCO is calculated as the minute volume of CO uptake over alveolar PCO (as capillary PCO is virtually none)
        - The minute volume of CO uptake is calculated as the difference in concentration of CO in inspired and expired breath between a 10 second breath hold interval
        - DLCO is then multiplied by 1.23 to obtain DLO2, adjusting for difference in molecular weight and solubility coefficient
    - **Advantages of using CO instead of O2 in measuring diffusion capacity**
        - CO has a much higher affinity for Hb than O2 (240 times greater), such that capillary PCO and hence back flow of CO is negligible
        - Diffusion of CO is diffusion limited, and not perfusion limited like O2, such that it is blood flow independent
    - **Normal values of DLCO and DLO2**
        - DLCO: 17-25 ml/mmHg
        - DLO2: 21-31 ml/mmHg
    - **Factors affecting pulmonary diffusion capacity**
        - Body size (which affects lung volume and surface area)
        - Age (loss of elasticity causes a decreae in surface area)
        - Lung volume (which affects surface area)
        - Body position (affects regional distribution of ventilation, DL increases from standing to sitting to supine)
        - Exercise (DL increases due to increase in surface area)

### Gas Transport

- Transport of O2
    - **Forms of O2 in blood**
        - Dissolved form - 1.5% (Obeys Henry's Gas Law)
        - Oxyhaemoglobin - 98.5% (subjected to cooperativity)
    - Oxygen content, oxygen capacity, oxygen saturation
        - **Definition oxygen content**
            - Oxygen content refers to the total amount of oxygen in blood, measured as %vol of blood
        - **Definition of oxygen capacity**
            - Oxygen capacity refers to the maximal amount of oxygen bound to haemoglobin, measured as %vol as well
        - **Definition of oxygen saturation**
            - Oxygen saturation refers to the percent saturation of haemoglobin with O2, i.e.
            - Amount of O2 bound to haemoglobin divided by oxygen capacity
    - Oxygen dissociation curve
        - **What is the oxygen dissociation curve? Describe its shape.**
            - Oxygen dissociation curve shows the content of O2 of blood at any time as a function of PO2
            - It is sigmoidal shape due to positive cooperativity
        - **Physiological significance of the shape of the oxygen dissociation curve**
            - When curve is above 60mmHg, the curve is flat, such that decrease in alveolar PO2 has little effect on loading of O2
            - When alveolar PO2 is below 60mmHg, the curve is steep, such that the SpO2 falls significantly for a small drop in PO2, facilitating the unloading of O2 in tissues
        - **Oxygen consumption by peripheral tissues according to O2 dissociation curve**
            - Arterial PO2 of 100 mmHg, results in content of O2 in blood to be 19.7%vol
            - Venous PO2 of 40 mmHg, results in content of O2 in blood to be 14.4%vol
            - The difference of 5.3%vol is the O2 consumption by peripheral tissues
        - **Shape of Oxygen dissociation curve of fetal haemoglobin and its physiological significance**
            - HbF has a much higher O2 affinity than that of HbA, causing a leftward shift of the O2 dissociation curve and making it more sigmoidal
            - This is physiologically significant as it facilitates loading of O2 in a hypoxic fetal environment
            - Furthermore, it drives O2 diffusion across the placenta (steal O2 from HbA of mother)
        - **Factors causing rightward shift in oxygen dissociation curve**
            - Increase in PCO2
            - Decrease in pH
            - Increase in temperature
            - Increase in 2,3-DPG
            - They work by lowering O2 affinity of Hb, facilitating additional unloading of O2 in tissues/ regions with low PO2
        - **Effects of PCO2 on oxygen dissociation curve and its action in tissues and lungs**
            - Bohr's Effect - Effect of PCO2 on oxygen dissociation curve
            - Tissues - increase in PCO2, results in an increase in [H+], which reduces O2 affinity of Hb, resulting in additional unloading of O2 to tissues
            - Lungs - decrease in PCO2, results in a decrease in [H+], which increases O2 affinity of Hb, facilitating loading of O2 to blood
- Transport of CO2
    - **Forms of CO2 in blood**
        - Dissolved CO2 - 10%
        - Bicarbonate ion - 70%
        - Carbamino compounds - 20%
        - Carbaminohaemoglobin (HbHCO2) - 20%
        - Plasma proteins (PrNHCO2) - < 1%
    - CO2 dissociation curve
        - **What is the CO2 dissociation curve? Describe it's shape.**
            - The CO2 dissociation curve shows the content of CO2 in blood at any time as a function of PCO2
            - It is linear
        - **Factors causing leftward shift in CO2 dissociation curve**
            - Decrease in PO2
        - **Effect of PO2 on CO2 dissociation curve and its action in tissue and lungs**
            - Haldane's Effect - Effect of PO2 on CO2 dissociation curve
            - Tissues - low PO2 facilitates loading of CO2 to Hb
            - Lungs - High PO2 facilitates unloading of CO2 from Hb
- Integration of O2 and CO2 transport mechanisms
    - **Interaction of O2 and CO2 transport mechanism in tissue**
        - In tissues, the high PCO2 results in an increase in [H+], reducing O2 affinity of oxygen, facilitating unloading of O2 by Hb to tissues (Bohr's effect)
        - The low PO2 facilitates in the loading of CO2 to Hb (Haldane's effect)
    - **Integration of O2 and CO2 transport mechanism in the lungs**
        - In the lungs, the low PCO2 results in a decrease in [H+], increasing O2 affinity of Hb, facilitating loading of O2 by Hb (Bohr's effect)
        - The high PO2 facilitates the unloading of CO2 from Hb (Haldane's effect)
