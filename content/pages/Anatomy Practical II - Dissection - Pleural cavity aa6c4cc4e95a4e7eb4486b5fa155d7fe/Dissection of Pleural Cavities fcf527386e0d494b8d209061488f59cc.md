# Dissection of Pleural Cavities

**Dissection Instructions**

1. Use your hands to explore the right and left pleural cavities. *Caution: The cut ends of the ribs are sharp and can cut you.* To reduce the risk of injury, blunt the ends of ribs 1 to 5 or place folded paper towels over the cut ends of the ribs before you begin to palpate the pleural cavities. Alternatively, fold the serratus anterior muscles over the cut ends before you begin to palpate the pleural cavities.
2. Use paper towels or a turkey baster to remove fluid that may have collected in the pleural cavity.
3. Identify the subdivisions of the **parietal pleura: costal**, **diaphragmatic**, **mediastinal**, and **cervical (pleural cupula)**. Part of the costal pleura was removed with the anterior thoracic wall. Note that endothoracic fascia underlies all the subdivisions of the parietal pleura.
4. Observe that the parietal pleura is folded sharply at the lines of pleural reflection, where the costal pleura meets the diaphragmatic pleura, and where the costal pleura meets the mediastinal pleura. The areas where one parietal pleura contacts another parietal pleura are called pleural recesses.
5. Place your fingers in the **costodiaphragmatic recesses**, which are located at the most inferior limits of the parietal pleura. Follow it posteriorly and notice the acute angle that the diaphragm makes with the inner surface of the thoracic wall.
6. Place your hand between the lung and the mediastinum and palpate the root of the lung. At the root of the lung, the mediastinal pleura is continuous with the visceral pleura. Palpate the **pulmonary ligament**, which extends inferior to the root of the lung. anchoring the inferior lobe of each lung to the mediastinum.
7. The root of the lung is attached to the mediastinum. All other parts of the lung should slide freely against the parietal pleura. Pleural adhesions may occur between visceral and parietal pleurae. Pleural adhesions are the result of disease processes, and you should use your fingers to break them.

****Dissection Follow-up****

1.  Replace the anterior thoracic wall in its correct anatomical position.
2.  Use an illustration and the dissected specimen to project the lines of pleural reflection to the anterior thoracic wall.
3.  Review the course of the intercostal nerves and understand that they provide somatic innervation (including pain fibers) to the costal pleura.
