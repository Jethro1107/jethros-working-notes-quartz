### Podocytes

- **Molecular composition of slit diaphragm between podocyte foot processes**
    
    Nephrin
    
    - **Structure of nephrin relating to its function**
        
        The carboxyl terminal of nephrins is located i the intracellular domain, where as amino terminal is located in the extracellular domain
        
        It pocesses immunoglobin loops that are maintained by cysteine-cystein disulfide bridges
        
        If cysteine of immunoglobin does not form a disulphide prdige, a spacer domain is formed
        
        Ig loops associatee with each other, and are impermeable to large molecules, whereas spacer domain allows larger molecules to pass through
        
        Nephrin interacts with intracellular partners (probably contractile proteins), to change size of spacer domains, thus regulating filtration

    Free ends of laminin polymers associate with receptors on endothelial cells such as integrin and dystroglycan, and hence laminin is closer to the cell surface
    
    Laminin associates with type IV collagen network via nidogens
    
    HSPG associates with laminin and collagen networks via heperan sulphate chains
