### Principles of renal diseases and Clinical Manifestation of renal diseases
- **Classification of renal disease**
    Renal diseases are classified into those that affect the four major morphological component of our kidney: glomeruli, tubules, interstitium and the blood vessels
    
    Hence, renal diseases can be classified into:
    
    Glomerular diseases
    Tubulointerstitial diseases
    Vascular diseases
- Diagnosis of renal diseases
    Can be diagnosed via clinical diagnosis, pathological diagnosis or on both the clinical and pathological basis

- **Common clinical manifestation of renal diseases**
    - Nephrotic syndrome
        - **Clinical presentation of nephrotic syndrome**
            Massive proteinuria - ≥ 3.5g per day
            
            Hypoalbuminemia
            
            Generalized oedema - due to hypoalbuminemia, thus results in reduced capillary oncotic pressure, thus resulting in increased fluid flux and oedema
            
            Hyperlipidemia (high cholesterol) - a maladaptation of the body to maintain osmolality  
        - **Which group of disease entities is nephrotic syndrome associated with?**
            Associated with glomerular disease:
            1. Membrane nephropathy
            2. Minimal change disease
            3. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis
            4. Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis
            5. Amyloidosis
        - **Complications of nephrotic syndrome**
            Hypercoagulability - risk of arterial and venous thromboembolism
            Hyperlipidemia and lipiduria
            Decreased serum binding proteins - raise plasma drug levels e.g. warfarin
            Increased risk of infection - due to loss of immunoglobin, complements and impaired neutrophil phagocytic functions
            Progressive renal failure     
    - Nephritic syndrome
        - **Clinical presentation of nephritic syndrome**
            Acute onset of gross haematuria (visible red blood cells in urine) or microscopic haematuria (red cell casts in urine on microscopy)
            
            Subnephrotic proteinuria
            
            Deminished glomerular filtration rate/ GFR - manifested as oliguria, azotemia
            
            Hypertension - as a result of fluid retention
        - **Which group of disease entities is nephritic syndrome associated with?**
            Associated with glomerular disease:
            Post infectious glomerulonephritis
    - Acute kidney injury (AKI)
        - **Clinical presentation of acute kidney injury**
            Defined as the rapid reduction of glomerular filtration rate in hours to days
            The abrupt onset of renal dysfunction is reflected by an acute onset in serum creatinine and urea and is associated with oliguria or anuria in severe forms of acute kidney injury
        - **Which group of disease entities is acute kidney injury associated with?**
		    - Associated with glomerular, tubular, interstitial and vascular diseases
    - Chronic kidney disease (CKD)
        - **Clinical presentation/definition of chronic kidney disease**
            Also known as chronic renal failure
            Defined as the persistent decline of GFR (≤ 60 ml/min/1.73m2) for 3 months
        - **Which group of disease entities is chronic kidney injury associated with?**
            Associated with glomerular, tubular, interstitial and vascular diseases
    - End stage renal disease (ESRD)
        - **Definition of end stage renal disease**
            ESRD is the final and irreversible stage of renal dysfunction defined as when GFR is less than 5% of normal
        - **Treatment of end stage renal disease?**
            Renal replacement therapy - dialysis and kidney transplant
    Cf: [Robbins: Clinical manifestations of renal diseases](https://www.notion.so/Robbins-Clinical-manifestations-of-renal-diseases-2b038dd2279c4bc48e1fc32510b1b2c2) 
- **What is azotemia and uraemia?**
    Azotemia - the biochemical abnormalities (i.e. elevated blood urea nitrogen/ BUN and serum creatinine) that is largely related to the a decrease in GFR
    Uraemia - When azotemia manifests as clinical signs and symptoms, it is called uraemia

### Glomerular disease
- Classification of glomerular diseases by etiology
	![[Pasted image 20220520105510.png]]
- **Pathogenesis of glomerular injury**
    - Mediated by immune mechanisms
        Mediated by immune complexes (more common):
        1. Glomerular injury may be caused by immune complex in situ, which can be either due to binding of antibody to intrinsic glomerular antigens, or the binding of antibody to normal component of glomerular basement membrane
	        - Binding to intrinsic glomerular antigen - membrane nephropathy (Autoantibodies binding to M-type phospholipase A2 receptors, PLA2R)
	        - Binding to normal components of GBM - Goodpasture syndrome, also known as Anti-GBM-mediated crescentic glomerulonephritis (Autoantibodies binding to Type IV collagen in GBM)
        2. Glomerular injury may also be caused by deposition of circulating immune complexes
	        - Immune complexes may be endogenous, e.g. Systemic lupus erythromatous / SLE,
	        - or exogenous, e.g. bacterial products (GAS/ streptococcal dysgalactiae), viral (Hepatitis B), parasitic (Plasmodium falciparum) or spirochetal (Treponema pallidum)
        
        Mediated by other immune mechanisms (less common):
	    -  Progression of glomerular diseases may be due to cell mediated immunity (demonstrated by the presence of macrophages and T lymphocytes)
	    - Glomerular diseases may also be caused by excessive activation of alternative complement pathways:
	        Dense deposit disease
	        C3 glomerulonephritis
        
        ![Untitled](CPR86%20Disease%20of%20the%20kidney%20I%20408abe85502c4985bbcd9bb9286d1fcc/Untitled%202.png)
        - **How does immune mechanisms cause glomerular injury?**
            1. Epithelial cell/ podocyte injury
                Podocyte injury can be induced by various immune mechanisms (e.g. antibody binding to podocyte antigen)
                Podocyte injury is characterised by effacement of pedicles, vacuolization, retraction and detatchment of podocyte from glomerular basement membrane
                
                ![Untitled](CPR86%20Disease%20of%20the%20kidney%20I%20408abe85502c4985bbcd9bb9286d1fcc/Untitled%203.png)
                This results in the loss of filtration slits, and often results in the development of proteinuria
                
            2. Glomerular injury
                As a result of immune related injury, this results in the decrease in number of functional glomeruli that causes the reduction of GFR
                This may result in compensatory hypertrophy of the remaining functional glomeruli in response to the loss of glomeruli
                These compensatory changes are maladaptive and leads to further podocyte and glomerular injury, resulting in focal segmental glomerulosclerosis
                Glomerulosclerosis further reduces the number of functional gloeruli, thus initiating the viscious cycle of progressive glomerulosclerosis
    - Metabolic alterations of GBM
    - Genetic defects of GBM synthesis and cellular proteins
- **Possible effects of glomerular injury**
    Proteinuria
    Haematuria
    Decrease in glomerular blood flow
    Decrease in glomerular filtration rate
    If irreversible damage is dealt, it results in chronic kidney disease and eventually end stage renal disease

### Glomerular disease classified by clinical manifestation
- Nephrotic syndrome
    - Membranous nephropathy
        - **What is membranous nephropathy?** 
            Membranous nephropathy is an immune complex mediated glomerulonephritis characterised by subepithelial deposits along the glomerular basement membrane
        - **Epidemiology of membranous nephropathy** 
            Usually occurs in 30-50 years old and follows an indolent and slowly progressive course
        - **Causes of membranous nephropathy**
            Primary membranous nephropathy (**70%**):
            Autoantibodies against podocyte M-type phospholipase A2 receptors (PLA2R)
            
            Secondary membranous nephropathy:
            Antibodies against planted exogenous antigens (e.g. Hepatitis B and C)
            Malignancies
            Autoimmune diseases - SLE, rheumatoid arthritis
            Drugs (especially NSAID)
            Sarcoidosis
        - **Pathogenesis of membranous nephropathy**
            Membranous nephropathy is a form of chronic immune complex glomerulonephritis mediated by antibodies reacting in situ with endogenous (PLA2R) or planted glomerular antigens, resulting in subepithelial immune complex deposits
            Immune complex deposits results in complement activation on podocytes and formation of membrane attacking complex
            This results in podocyte injury and proteinuria
        - **Glomerular pathology in membranous nephropathy**
            Light microscopy - Diffuse thickening of capillary wall on routine H&E staining and subendothelial spike formation on silver stain
