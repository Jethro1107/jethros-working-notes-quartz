Bulk flow by ventilation can be described by the equation:

*F* = ∆*P*/*R ... 13-1*

Flow (F) is proportional to the pressure difference between two points, and inversely proportional to the resistance

Regarding ventilation, the relevant pressures are the alveolar pressure (Palv) and the atmospheric pressure (Patm):

*F* = (*P*alv – *P*atm)/*R ... 13-2*

During ventilation, air moves into and out of the lungs because the alveolar pressure is alternately less than and greater than atmospheric pressure . When *P*alv is less than *P*atm, the driving force for air flow is negative, indicating that air flow is inward (inspiration). When *P*alv is greater than *P*atm, the driving force for air flow is positive (equation 13–2), indicating that air flow is outward (expiration). These alveolar pressure changes are caused, as we will see, by changes in the dimensions of the chest wall and lungs.
