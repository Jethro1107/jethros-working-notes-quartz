What are the forces that cause *P*ip to be negative? The first, the **elastic recoil** of the lungs, is defined as the tendency of an elastic structure to oppose stretching or distortion. Even at rest, the lung contains air, and its natural tendency is to collapse because of elastic recoil. The lungs are held open by the positive *P*tp, which, at rest, exactly opposes elastic recoil.

Transpulmonary pressure can be thought as the distending pressure of lungs

During inspiration, intrapleural pressure becomes more subatmospheric, causing transpulmonary pressure to increase

Distending pressure > recoil pressure, causing lung to expand until recoil pressure increases such that distending pressure = recoiling pressure

During expiration, intrapleural pressure becomes less negative and transpulmonary pressure decrease back to preinspiration value

Distending pressure < recoil pressure, causing lung to recoil back to preinspiration size
