Another important property of surfactant is that it stabilizes alveoli of different sizes by altering surface tension, depending on the surface area of the alveolus. As an alveolus gets smaller, the molecules of surfactant on its inside surface are less spread out, thus reducing surface tension. The reduction in surface tension helps to maintain a pressure in smaller alveoli equal to that in larger ones. This gives stability to alveoli of different sizes.
