**Lung Compliance**

To repeat, the degree of lung expansion at any instant is proportional to the transpulmonary pressure, *P*alv – *P*ip. But just how much any given change in transpulmonary pressure expands the lungs depends upon the stretchability, or compliance, of the lungs. 

**Lung compliance (*CL*)** is defined as the magnitude of the change in lung volume (∆*VL*) produced by a given change in the transpulmonary pressure:

lung compliance due to disease therefore tend to breathe shallowly and must breathe at a higher frequency to inspire an adequate volume of air.

Explanation: 

Compliance is the inverse of elasticity / resistance to distension

Low compliance ⇒ high elasticity and high recoil pressure ⇒ stiff lungs
