### Important Surface Landmarks

> The Rib level is generally lower than the numerically corresponding vertebral level
> 

### Basic dissection techniques

- Blunt dissection technique
    - Scissors technique for separating structures. Closed scissors are inserted between structures into the connective tissue and then opened to gently spread the tissue
- Button hole technique
    - Buttonhole technique. M ake a stab incision in a flap of skin. P ull on the skin as hard as you can. Use the scalpel blade to cut along where the fibers are taut.
- Scalpel technique
    - Just like holding a pen

### Surface anatomy of thorax

- Surface anatomy of chest wall
    - Jugular notch
        - Vertebral correspondence of jugular notch
    - Angle of Louis
        - Vertebral correspondence of sternal angle
            - T4/T5
        - Anatomical significance of sternal angle
            - Boundary between superior and inferior mediastinum
            - Tracheal bifurcation
            - End of azygos system into SVC
            - Ligamentum arteriosum
            - Ligamentum arteriosum is an embryonic remnant that attaches to the inferior border of the aortic arch and the superior border of the pulmonary trunk at the point of bifurcation
            - Start and end of aortic arch
            - Loop of left recurrent laryngeal nerve aroud aortic arch
            
    - Xiphisternal joint
        - Vertebral correspondence of jugular notch
            - T9
- Surface anatomy of pleura
    - Apical border of pleura
        - Curved line drawn from the sternoclavicular joint to the junction between medial and middle third of the clavicle, where highest point is about 1 inch above the clavicle and is more medial
    - Medial border of pleura
        - Line drawn from sternoclavicular line to 6th costal cartilage
    - Inferior border of pleura
        - Line joining 3 points:
        - 8th rib at mid clavicular line
        - 10th rib at mid axillary line
        - 12th rib at posterior paravertebral line
- Surface anatomy of the lungs
    - Apical border of lungs
        - Curved line drawn from the sternoclavicular joint to the junction between medial and middle third of the clavicle, where highest point is about 1 inch above the clavicle and is more medial
    - Medial border of lungs
        - Line drawn from sternoclavicular to 6th costal cartilage
    - Inferior (Diaphragmatic) border of lungs
        - line joining 3 points:
        - 6th rib at mid clavicular line
        - 8th rib at mid axillary line
        - 10th rib at posterior paravertebral line
- Surface anatomy of heart
    - Left border of heart
        - A line between 1cm from left edge of sternum at 2nd costal cartilage and 5th intercostal space at midclavicular line (apex beat)
        - left border of heart lies on left ventricle
    - Right border of heart
        - A line between 1cm from right edge of sternum at 3rd costal cartilage and 1cm from right edge of sternum at 6th costal cartilage
        - right border of heart lies on right atrium
- Triangle of safety
    - Borders of triangle of safety
        - Anterior border by lateral edge of pectoralis major
        - Posterior border by lateral edge of lattisimus dorsi muscle
        - 5th intercostal space (horizontal line from nipple usually)
    - When to identify triangle of safety
        - When placing intercostal catheter
