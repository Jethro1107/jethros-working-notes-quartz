- [[Principles of Sangar sequencing]]
		- Sangar sequencing is based on the principle that 3'OH is required for DNA elongation
		- ![[IAS06 Nucleic acids - DNA and RNA#^7f0ebb]]
		- It involves amplification of DNA, where dNTP (deoxynucleotides) is mixed with ddNTP (dideoxynucleotides)
		- When ddNTP is incorporated into the growing nucleotide chain, it results in chain termination due to the lack of 3'OH
		- This results in formation sequences of different sizes, which can be separated by gel electrophoresis to work out the sequence
