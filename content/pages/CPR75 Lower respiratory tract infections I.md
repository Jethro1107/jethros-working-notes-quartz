### Pertussis (whooping cough)
- **What is pertussis?**
    Pertussis is a respiratory illness caused by the gram negative coccobacilli, Bordetella pertussis, characterised by inspiratory whoop, paroxysmal cough and postussive emesis
- **Etiology of pertussis**
    Bordetella pertussis - a gram negative coccobacilli
    - **Virulence factors of bordetella pertussis**
        Attachment - Filamentous haemagglutinin, Fimbrae
        
        Toxins - Pertussis toxins (PT), Adenylate cyclase toxin (ACT), Tracheal cytotoxin, Dermonecrotic toxin (DNT), Pertactin (PTN)
        
        *Pertussis is a toxin-mediated disease
- **Transmission of pertussis**
    Transmitted by respiratory droplets
- **Clinical manifestations of pertussis**
    Classical pertussis presents with 3 phases: Catarrhal stage, paroxysmal stage and covalescent stage
    
    Catarrhal stage (non-specific) - Rhinorrhea, lacrimation, conjuctival injection, low grade fever, dry cough
    
    Paroxysmal stage (specific):
    Hallmark symptom of pertussis - Paroxysmal cough, i.e. a series of severe, vigorous cough with little to no inspiratory efforts in between, followed by an inspiratory whoop, the forced inspiratory effort following each attack
    [Shibboleth Authentication Request](https://www-uptodate-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/contents/images/CARD/80861/Pertussisinfantvid.mp4)
    [Shibboleth Authentication Request](https://www-uptodate-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/contents/images/CARD/57822/Classicalwhoopingconv.mp4)
    May result in cyanosis (hypoxemia)
    Postussive emesis (vomiting) often follows the paroxysmal cough
    
    Covalescent stage - cough subsides after weeks or months
