## Fibrous Proteins
- **Learning Outcomes**
    To differentiate globular and fibrous proteins
    To describe the structure of collagen and keratin
- Fibrous Proteins vs Globular Proteins

    Fibrous proteins have long extended repetitive sequences that enable structural roles
    Globular proteins are entirely soluble in aqueous environment
- **Structure of Collagen**

    (a) - single left-handed alpha helix
    (c) - three left-handed alpha helix form a right handed triple-helix (super helix)
    The repetitive sequence of collagen - Glycine-proline-hydroxyproline

    Collagens assemble into fibrils, a supermolecular structure
    
    Striations due to evenly-spaced interactions between collagen molecules, where heads of collagen molecules come together in a repetitive fashion to form striated patterns

    Vitamin C, a redycing agent keeps Fe2+ reduced to sustain prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity, allowing the synthesis of hydroxyproline, resulting in the synthesis of collagen
- **Structure of Keratin**
    ![Screenshot 2021-09-08 at 2.25.45 PM.png](IAS08%20Proteins%20Diversity%20a97b3879931f43d5b24a8ccfc8fb0c87/Screenshot_2021-09-08_at_2.25.45_PM.png)
    
    Keratin includes two alpha helices (coiled coil)
    alpha helix ⇒ coiled coil ⇒ protofilament ⇒ protofibril ⇒ intermediate filament
    disulphide bond stabilises keratin

## Oxygen-Binding Proteins
- Leaning Outcomes
    
    To illustrate the interplay between haemoglobin and myoglobin in oxygen transport
    
    To explain cooperativity in ligand binding, exemplifying by haemoglobin function and carbon monoxide poisoning
- **Structure of Haem and oxygen binding mechanism**
	- Haem is the iron-containing non-protein part (prosthetic group) of myoglobin and haemoglobin
	- Haem consist of a porphyrin ring and Fe2+ at the centre, where Fe2+ binds to oxygen
	- Histidine in the haemoglobin or mygobin subunits stabilize the oxygen in position

    ![AE9B794D-C95A-4017-81DE-8597EBA1C032.jpeg|375](IAS08%20Proteins%20Diversity%20a97b3879931f43d5b24a8ccfc8fb0c87/AE9B794D-C95A-4017-81DE-8597EBA1C032.jpeg)
- **Myoglobin vs Haemoglobin**
	- Myoglobin functions to facilitate diffusion in muscles, while haemoglobin carries oxygen in blood
	- Myoglobin is monomeric with one haem, while haemoglobin is tetrameric with four haems
    ![83857B79-D97B-420D-B52A-3A3E6A2AF2F1.jpeg](IAS08%20Proteins%20Diversity%20a97b3879931f43d5b24a8ccfc8fb0c87/83857B79-D97B-420D-B52A-3A3E6A2AF2F1.jpeg)
- **Positive cooperativity**
    - When the first ligand binds to the binding site of a subunit, it results in the structural change of the other subunits, where the new conformation has a higher affinity to oxygen
    - Due to the change in affinity, haemoglobin has two states:
	    -  T-state - low affinity to oxygen (bind loosely)
	    - R-state - high affinity to oxygen (bind strongly)
	    -  As more oxygen binds to T-state haemoglobin, it changes to R-state
	    - This enables haemoglobin to switch to R-state at high PO2, and T-state ate low PO2
- **Carbon monoxide poisoning and its effects on haemoglobin cooperativity**
    ![D5715463-3A08-4060-85BF-69733CEAC69D.jpeg](IAS08%20Proteins%20Diversity%20a97b3879931f43d5b24a8ccfc8fb0c87/D5715463-3A08-4060-85BF-69733CEAC69D.jpeg)
    
    Carbon monoxide:
    1. takes up haem otherwise for oxygen (oxygen carrying capacity similar to anemic individual)
    2. Disrupts positive cooperativity, locking it in R-state (high affinity), prevents the release of O2 in tissues
    Referring to curve, the loss of haemoglobin cooperativity is the killing factor

## Protein Folding and Disease
- **Learning Outccomes**
    
    To understand that proteins can fold into alternative conformations
    
    To describe how protein misfolding and aggregation associate with disease
- **Process of Protein Folding**
    Protein fold through progressive stabilisation of intermediates, goes through a protein folding funnel, determined by the amino acid sequence
    
    Maybe form first alpha helix, beta sheet
    
    Chaperones (protein complexes that fold protein) generally require ATP to fold proteins

	- Some proteins exist in multiple conformations
- Diseases involving misfolding proteins

    Filaments formed from assembly is toxic to the brain, causing Alzheimers
