# CPR03: Anatomy of the lungs, pleura, diaphragm and respiration

### Anatomy of the Lungs and Pleura
- How many lobes do the two lungs have? What are the names of the lobes?
    The **right lung** has 3 lobes - The right upper lobe, the right middle lobe, and the right lower lobe
    
    The **left lung** has 2 lobes - The left upper lobe, and the left lower lobe
- What are the 2 pleural layers in the pulmonary cavities? Are they two distinctive layers?
    The two pleural layers are the **visceral pleura** and the **parietal pleura**
    
    The visceral pleura adheres the surface of the lungs, while the parietal pleura adheres to the thoracic wall
    
    The visceral pleura and the parietal pleura are **continuous** layers:
    
    The visceral pleura is continuous with the parietal pleura at the hilum of the lung

- What are fissures? How are they formed?
    Fissures are 2 folds of visceral pleura, as the visceral pleura envelopes each lobe
    
    The **left lobe**, only having 2 lobes, will have 1 fissure, the obliques fissure
    
    The **right lobe**, having three lobes, will have 2 fissures:
    
    The horizontal fissure separates the right upper lung and the right middle lung
    
    The obliques fissure separates the right middle lung and the right lower lung
- What is the layer of connective tissue between the internal thoracic wall and parietal pleura?
    **Endothoracic fascia** - A layer of loose connective tissue connecting inner chest wall and the parietal pleura
- What is the blood supply of the lungs?
    Supplied by the bronchial artery and vein, which supply:
    
    The connective tissue of the lungs, the bronchi and the visceral pleura
- **Nerve supply of the lungs**
    Lung is innervated by the **pulmonary plexus**, consisting of:
    
    Sympathetic fibres arising from **T2 to T5** providing **sympathetic innervation**, and
    
    **Vagus Nerve** (CN X) providing **parasympathetic innervation**
- What is the nerve supply of the pleura?
    The **visceral pleura** is innervated by the pulmonary plexus (T2-T5 sympathetic fibres, vagus nerve)
    
    The **parietal pleura** is innervated by intercostal nerves, except the **central diaphragmatic and mediastinal pleura**, which are innervated by the phrenic nerve
- What is present within the lung hilum? Describe the general orientation of these structures.
    Structures with the **lung hilum**:
    1. Pulmonary artery
    2. Pulmonary veins
    3. Lymph nodes
    4. Nerves
    5. Bronchus
    6. Bronchial arteries and veins
    
    The **general arrangement** of the structures is as follows:
    
    **Pulmonary artery** - Superiormost on the left hilum
    
    **Superior and inferior pulmonary vein** - anteriormost and inferiormost respectively
    
    **Bronchus** - against and approximately in the middle of the posterior boundary

- Describe the surface anatomy of pleura and lungs.
    
    Along imaginary lines such as the **mid-clavicular line, mid-axillary line and the posterior paravertebral line**, the position of the lungs and the parietal pleura can be determined
    
    When the **mid-clavicular line** is used:
    
    The **lung** is located at the 6th rib
    
    The **parietal pleura** is located at the 10th rib
    
    When the **mid-axillary line** is used:
    
    The **lung** is located at the 8th rib
    
    The **parietal pleura** is located at the 10th rib
    
    When the **posterior paravertebral line** is used:
    
    The **lung** is located at the 10th rib
    
    The **parietal pleura** is located at the 12th rib
- Describe the lymphatic drainage of the lungs.
    
    Understanding of Lymphatic drainage of the lungs is vital for understanding the metastasis via the lymphatic route
    
    **Superficial lymph nodes/ plexus** is located beneath the visceral pleura, and drains interstitial fluid in the superficial lung parenchyma and visceral pleura, which drains directly into the **bronchopulmonary (hilar) nodes** on the hilum of the lungs
    
    **Deep lymph plexus** is located in the submucosa of the bronchi, which drains into the **pulmonary node**, and eventually into the **bronchopulmonary nodes**
    
    The **bronchopulonary node** then drains into the **tracheobronchial node**
    
    The **tracheobronchial node** then drains into the **paratracheal node**
    
    **Right paratracheal node** drain into the **right bronchomediastinal lymphatic trunk**, which would then drain into the **right lymphatic duct**
    
    The **left paratracheal node** drain into the **left bronchomediastinal lymphatic trunk**, which would then drain into the **thoracic duct**
    
    [(Moore’s Clinically Oriented Anatomy p.130-131)](CPR03%20Anatomy%20of%20the%20lungs,%20pleura,%20diaphragm%20and%20%208c3952d3807e40989be46dca9e0909fb/Lymphatic%20drainage%20of%20the%20lung%20ee001a375eff442ca22715f7057d701e.md)

### Anatomy of the Diaphragm
- What are the different structures of the diaphragm?
    1. Muscular part
    2. Central tendon
    3. Posterior ligaments - Provide posterior attachment and support for diaphragm:
        - Lateral arcuate ligament
        - Medial arcuate ligament
        - Median arcuate ligament
    4. Openings
- What are the different diaphragmatic opening?
    
    **Caval opening** - Inferior Vena Cava, Phrenic nerve
    
    **Oesophageal hiatus** - Oesophagus, vagus nerve, branches of gastric vessels, lymphatics
    
    **Aortic hiatus** - Aorta, azygous vein, thoracic duct
- What is the blood supply of the diaphragm?
    Supplied by the musculophrenic arteries (branch of ITA) and veins
    
    Supplied by inferior phrenic arteries (branch of abdominal aorta) and veins
- What is the nerve supply of the diaphragm?
    Phrenic nerves (derived from C3-C5)

### Movements during Respiration
- What happens in quiet inspiration and expiration?
    Inspiration:
    
    Contraction of diaphragm causes the increase in height of the thoracic cavity
    
    Contraction of the intercostal muscles causes the increase anterior posterior diameter and transverse diameter 
    
    This increases the negative intrathoracic pressure, causing the lung to expand
    
    Expiration:
    
    Relaxation of the diaphragm causes a decrease in height of the thoracic cavity
    
    Relaxation of the intercostal muscles cause the decrease in AP diameter and TD
    
    This allows the intrathoracic pressure to return normal, allowing the elastic recoil of the lungs
- What happens in active/forced inspiration?
    First rib is fixed by scalene muscles
    
    Contraction of Diaphragm and intercostal muscles
    
    Contraction of serratus and pectoralis muscles causing further expansion of lungs
- What happens in active/forced expiration?
    12th rib fixed by quadratus lumborum muscle
    
    Contraction of latissimus dorsi to pull down lower ribs
    
    Contraction of abdominal muscles to increase intraabdominal pressure to compress lungs
