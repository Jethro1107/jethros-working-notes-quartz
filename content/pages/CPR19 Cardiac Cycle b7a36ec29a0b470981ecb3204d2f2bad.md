### Cardiac cycle

- **General definition of cardiac cycle**
    - Cardiac cycle is the sequence of events that occur in one heart beat, with alternating periods of contraction and relaxation
- Systole and diastole
    - **Definition of systole and diastole and corresponding phases of cardiac cycle**
        - Systole - period of ventricular contraction (isovolumetric ventricular contraction, and ventricular ejection)
        - Diastole - period of ventricular relaxation (isovolumetric ventricular rexation, ventricular filling and atrial contraction)
- **5 Phases of cardiac cycle**
    - End-diastole:
        - Phase 1 - Atrial contraction (active filling)
            - **Mechanical events of atrial contraction**
                - Before atrial contraction, atrial pressure is greater then ventricular pressure, such that AV valves open, allowing passive filling of ventricle before atrial contraction
                - Triggered by atrial depolarization, the atria contract, causing slight increase in atrial pressure, forcing an additional small volume of blood to the ventricles (raising ventricular pressure a bit), such that ventricular volume reaches end-diastolic volume (sometimes refered to ‘atria kick’)

    - Systole:
        - Phase 2 - Isovolumetric ventricular contraction
            - **Mechanical events in isovolumetric ventricular contraction**
                - Triggered by ventricular depolarization, the ventricle contracts, causing abrupt increase in ventricular pressure
                - As ventricular pressure immediately becomes greater than atrial pressure, the AV valve close to prevent backflow of blood into atria, resulting in S1
                - Ventricular pressure is lower than that of aortic and pulmonary arterial pressure, such that it semilunar valves remain closed, and hence ventricle cannot empty, resulting in constant ventricular volume
                - Note the small increase in atrial pressure, which is caused by AV valves buldging into atria, causing decrease in atrial volume and increase in atrial pressure transiently

        - Phase 3 - Ventricular ejection
            - **Mechanical events in ventricular ejection**
                - Ventricular pressure rises above aortic and pulmonary arterial pressure, such that semilunar valves opens, and ventricle ejects blood into aorta and pulmonary artery, causing a decrease in ventricular volume to end-systolic volume
                - Aortic pressure and pulmonary arterial pressure rise due to entry of blood into arteries stretch the walls of the arteries
                - Ventricular ejection is separated into 2 phase:
                    - Rapid ejection period, in which corresponds to plateau period of the action potential, causing increased ventricular muscle tension
                    - Reduced ejection period, which corresponds to the repolarization period of the action potential, causing reduced ventricular muscle tension

    - Early and mid-diastole:
        - Phase 4 - Isovolumetric ventricular relaxation
            - **Mechanical events of isovolumetric ventricular relaxation**
                - Ventricular pressure falls below aortic and pulmonary arterial pressure, causing semilunar valves to shut to prevent backflow of blood into the ventricles, resulting in S2
                - Ventricular pressure remains greater than atrial pressure, such that the AV valves remain shut, hence ventricular volume remains constant at end-systolic volume
        - Phase 5 - Ventricular filling (passive filling)
            - **Mechanical events of ventricular filling**
                - Ventricular pressure fall below atrial pressure, causing AV valves to open, allowing passive filling of ventricles to occur, resulting increase in ventricular volume
- Pressure-volume loop

- **Calculation of stroke volume**
    - Stroke volume = end-diastolic volume - end-systolic volume

### Heart sounds relating to cardiac cycle

- **Two heart sounds**
    - S1
        - **Strutural basis of S1**
            - Closure of AV valves (tricuspid valve and mitral valve)
    - S2
        - **Structural basis of S2**
            - Closure of semilunar valves (pulmonary valve and aortic valve)
- **Defining systole and diastole with the heart sounds**
    
    Systole - Between S1 and S2
    
    Diastole - between S2 and S1 of next cardiac cycle
    

### Blood pressures relating to cardiac cycle

- **What is blood pressure based on?**
    - Directly related to blood volume
- **Two measurable blood pressures and definition**
    - Systolic pressure - Maximal arterial pressure attained at peak ventricular ejection
    - Diastolic pressure - minimum arterial pressure attained just before ventricular ejection
