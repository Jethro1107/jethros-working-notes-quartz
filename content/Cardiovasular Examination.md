- # Cardiovascular examination
- The cardiovascular examination consist of 4 parts: 1) [[#General examination|General inspection of the patient]], 2) [[#Examination of the arterial system Examination of arterial pulse|Examination of arterial pulse]] 3) [[#Examination of the venous system Examination of the jugular venous pressure|Examination of jugular venous pressure]], and 4) [[#Precordial examination]].

- ### General examination
	- During general examination, it is better to first inspect the body habitus, then proceed down the body of the patient, proceeding cranially to caudally.
	- **Body habitus**
		- Marfan’s syndrome
		- Down’s syndrome
		- Turner’s syndrome
	- **Head**
		- Eyes - Certain signs should be assessed:
			-  Conjunctival pallor (reflecting anaemia)
			-  Sclera for Jaundice (reflecting congestive heart failure and underlying hepatic congestion)
			-  Xanthelasma - deposition of lipids around the eye (reflecting hypercholesteremia)
		- Tongue - Central cyanosis should be assessed ([Central cyanosis is always pathological](https://www.notion.so/Central-cyanosis-is-always-pathological-9843a8278c6d4392a9b2065050827c06))
	- **Hands**
		- **Inspection** - Three things should be inspected on the hands:
			-  [Clubbing](https://www.notion.so/Clubbing-969d9890a56149fe9fc6303fcedaf250)
			-  Signs of infective endocarditis (Osler’s nodes, Janeway lesions, Splinter haemorrhage)
			-  Xanthomas (deposition of lipids in hand joints or around the elbows)
		- **Palpation** - of the radial pulse:
			-   Palpate radial pulse bilaterally, assessing for rate, rhythm, character and volume
			-   When palpating the radial pulse bilaterally, check for radial-radial delay
			-   Radial-femoral pulse should be assessed
	- **Legs**
	- When inspecting the legs, three things should be assessed:
		-  [[Pitting oedema]]
		-  Signs of deep vein thrombosis
		-  Signs of varicose veins

- ### Examination of the arterial system/ Examination of arterial pulse
	- 3 arterial pulses should be used when assessing the arterial system: 1) Radial pulse, 2) Brachial pulse, 3) Carotid pulse
	- **Radial pulse**
		- The radial pulse is used to assess the rate and rhythm, as well as the presence of radial-radial delay or radial-femoral delay, which is usually performed in general examination.
		- Character and volume can also be assessed at the radial pulse, particularly for a collapsing pulse and pulsus alternans.

	- **Carotid pulse**
		- **Palpation** of the carotid pulse can also be used to assess rate and rhythm, as well as the character and volume.
		- **Auscultation** - [[#^cc4a44|The carotid pulse is auscultated as a part of the precordial examination.]]
	- **Brachial pulse**

- ### Examination of the venous system/ Examination of the jugular venous pressure

	- The [[Jugular venous pressure]] is assessed for its height and character.
	- [[Jugular venous pressure#Clinical skills - Assessing the jugular venous pressure]]

- ### Precordial examination
	- Precordial examination involves 3 components: 1) [[#^72ea87|Inspection]], 2) [[#^adb7b4|Palpation]] and 3) [[#^9668f7]]
	- **Inspection** ^72ea87
		- Inspect for scars (in the axillary region and chest) or other chest wall deformities
		- Inspect for any visible apex beat or abnormal impulses
	- **Palpation** ^adb7b4
		- Palpate for the apex beat:
		-   Normally, the apex beat is located at left 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line
		-   The apex beat is a localised tapping, early systolic outward thrust
		-   Abnormal character of apex beat
		    -   Heaving (pressure overload) - a displaced, forceful, sustained impulse, usually seen in aortic stenosis and hypertension
		    -   Thrusting (volume overload) - a diffuse, non-sustained impulse, common in mitral regurgitation and dilated cardiomyopathy
		    -   Tapping
		- Parasternal heave:
		- Parasternal heave is palpated at lower left sternal border
		- Normally, parasternal impulse is impalpable, but may be detected as a palpated in patients with severe right heart hypertrophy or severe left atrial dilatation (displacing the right ventricle anteriorly.
		- Thrills:
		- Assess for thrills in the four palpable areas, which are vibrations associated with heart murmurs
	- **Auscultation** ^9668f7
		- Auscultation with diaphragm should be done for the mitral valve, tricuspid valve, pulmonary valve and aortic valve
		- Mitral stenosis (auscultate cardiac apex with bell in left lateral position) - Low pitched, late diastolic murmur with an opening snap
		- Mitral regurgitation - Pan-Systolic murmur/ Holosystolic murmur with a blowing quality, radiating to axilla. If it does not radiate to axilla, think of gallavardin phenomenon seen in aortic stenosis

		- Aortic regurgitation (best heard in deep expiration position) - Early diastolic murmur, best heard at left parasternal border at 3rd/4th intercostal space
		- [](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZysrKXHJMM&ab_channel=Medzcool)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZysrKXHJMM&ab_channel=Medzcool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZysrKXHJMM&ab_channel=Medzcool)
		- Aortic stenosis - Systolic click and systolic murmur which radiates to carotids (Auscultate for carotid bruits with bell), S2 is deminished

		- For mitral murmurs, turn the patient to a left lateral position
		- For aortic murmurs, ask the patient to sit up and hold breath at expiration
